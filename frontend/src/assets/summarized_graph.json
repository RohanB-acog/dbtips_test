IRF5 plays a crucial role in the immune response and has been identified as a significant genetic determinant in the development of SLE. Specifically, IRF5 is associated with polymorphisms that influence the susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus. Furthermore, IRF5 defines risk and protective haplotypes for human lupus, indicating that certain genetic variations in IRF5 can either increase the risk of developing SLE or provide a protective effect against the disease.
