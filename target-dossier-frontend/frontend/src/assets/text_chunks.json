In children with AD, sOX40 levels were comparable with adult AD levels (9.7; 2.0\u201324.6 pg/ml) (Fig. 1A).

		" this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness when used as treatment for AD.\nTogether, these findings indicate a close correlation between the OX40 system and atopic diseases.\nIn conclusion, OX40 expression is increased on skinhoming T cells and, together with our finding that OX40 and OX40L are co-localized in the skin, the OX40-OX40L system may play an important role in the recruitment to and activation of these cells in the skin. This finding is supported by the association of disease activity and atopic co-morbidities in atopic dermatitis, and we hypothesize that the OX40 system plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction in the skin. It is therefore of interest to follow the development of AD treatments targeting the OX40 system.\n The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. \n\nSection Type: REF\nText: REFERENCES\nAtopic dermatitis\nNew insights into atopic dermatitis\nThe role of TNF superfamily members in T-cell function and diseases\nOX40 promotes Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression and is essential for long-term survival of CD4 T cells\nThe OX40 costimulatory receptor determines the development of CD4 memory by regulating primary clonal expansion\nOX40-OX40 ligand interaction in T-cell-mediated immunity and immunopathology\nSoluble OX40L is associated with presence of autoantibodies in early rheumatoid arthritis\nSOX40L: an important inflammatory mediator in adult bronchial asthma\nInterruption of the OX40-OX40 ligand pathway in LDL receptor-deficient mice causes regression of atherosclerosis\nControl of immunity by the TNFR-related molecule OX40 (CD134)\nCritical role for OX40 ligand in the development of pathogenic Th2 cells in a murine model of asthma\nT cell proliferation by direct cross-talk between OX40 ligand on human mast cells and OX40 on human T cells: comparison of gene expression profiles between human tonsillar and lung-cultured mast cells\nTechnical advance: soluble OX40 molecule mimics regulatory T cell modulatory activity on FcepsilonRI-dependent mast cell degranulation\nMast cells produce interleukin-25 upon Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation\nMast cells enhance T cell activation: importance of mast cell costimulatory molecules and secreted TNF\nDiagnostic features of atopic dermatitis\nA simple set of validation steps identifies and removes false results in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay caused by anti-animal IgG antibodies in plasma from arthritis patients\nSerum OX40 ligand levels in asthmatic children: a potential biomarker of severity and persistence\nOX40 ligand: a potential costimulatory molecule in atopic asthma\nThe upregulated expression of OX40/OX40L and their promotion of T cells proliferation in the murine model of asthma\nCrucial role of OX40/OX40L signaling in a murine model of asthma\nGBR 830, an anti-OX40, improves skin gene signatures and clinical scores in patients with atopic dermatitis\n",

Although the patients in the study cohort were included based on their presentation of AD, some patients also had allergic rhinitis and asthma. This subsequently made it possible to examine the association of serum levels of sOX40 and sOX40L and atopic comorbidities in patients with AD.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated elevated sOX40L levels in patients with active allergic asthma. This was further supported by Farres et al., who showed that increased expression of OX40L on B cells is associated with the level of total IgE in allergic asthma patients. These findings are in line with murine asthma models, in which OX40L is highly expressed by a variety of cells within the lung during an induced allergic reaction. Although, in general, decreased serum levels were observed in AD, adults with concomitant asthma had the highest levels of serum sOX40. As with all members of the TNF-super family, sOX40 can bind to its ligand expressed by different cell types. This may explain the decrease in serum levels of sOX40. However, in our experiments we observed similar levels of sOX40L in healthy volunteers and patients with AD and, thus, circulating sOX40L is not an appropriate marker of disease activity in AD.\nMore interestingly, focusing on circulating skin-homing CD4+ T cells from patients with AD we observed an increase in expression of OX40. As skin-homing T cells are able to upregulate OX40 expression, an increased number of pathogenic T cells can migrate to the inflammatory site of the skin and thereby enhance local inflammation.\nIn addition, this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness",
		"Section Type: TITLE\nText: Association of TNFSF4 (OX40L) polymorphisms with susceptibility to systemic sclerosis\n\nSection Type: ABSTRACT\nText: Objective\nIt is increasingly being appreciated that multiple autoimmune diseases share common susceptibility genes. The tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4, OX40L), which encodes for the T cell costimulatory molecule OX40 ligand, has been identified as a susceptibility gene for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to investigate the possible association of the TNFSF4 gene region with systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune disease that leads to the development of cutaneous and visceral fibrosis.\nMethods\nA total of 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TNFSF4 gene region, previously associated with susceptibility to SLE, were tested for association with SSc in a collection of 1059 patients with SSc and 698 controls.\nResults\nCase-control comparisons revealed a significant association between susceptibility to SSc and the minor alleles at SNPs rs1234314 (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.4, pFDR=0.019), rs2205960 (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.50, pFDR=0.019) and rs844648 (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.30, pFDR=0.032). The minor allele at rs844644 was protective (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.97, pFDR=0.038). Analysis of subsets of patients with SSc demonstrated significant associations of the TNFSF4 SNPs with limited and diffuse SSc as well as specific SNPs that were associated with SSc-associated autoantibodies. Finally, the analyses suggest a potential interaction between two TNFSF4 SNPs, rs2205960 and rs844648, with regards to SSc susceptibility.\nConclusions\nPolymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene region are associated with susceptibility to SSc and its clinical and autoantibody subsets. TNFSF4 may be another gene that confers risk to multiple autoimmune diseases.\n\nSection Type: INTRO\nText: Introduction\nRecently, a number of reports have identified genes that are associated with the development of multiple autoimmune diseases suggesting that autoimmune diseases share genetic risk factors. For example, PTPN22 has been associated with the development of type I diabetes mellitus (TIDM), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). STAT4 is a susceptibility gene for the development of SLE and RA. Together these studies implicate dysregulation of common immune pathways due to polymorphisms in several genes in the development of a variety of autoimmune diseases.\nThe tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4, OX40L), which encodes for the costimulatory molecule OX40 ligand, has been identified as a susceptibility gene for SLE in multiple studies. To date, polymorphisms in TNFSF4 also have been associated with atherosclerosis, but there are no published reports of the association of TNFSF4 with autoimmune diseases such as RA, TIDM, or systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc).\nSSc is a chronic multisystem disease clinically characterised by progressive fibrosis in the skin and internal organs. Pathologically, SSc exhibits three cardinal features: inflammation and autoimmunity, vasculopathy and excessive extracellular matrix deposition. The immune alterations that lead to the development of SSc are unknown, but multiple lines of evidence suggest that SSc may share common immune alterations with SLE. For example, similar to SLE, patients with SSc have a myriad of circulating antinuclear antibodies. Furthermore, peripheral blood cells from a subset of patients with SLE and SSc have a pattern of upregulation of type I interferon associated gene transcripts. These data now have been extended at the genetic level where SLE and SSc have been associated with polymorphisms in the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) gene, STAT4, PTPN22 and FAS. \nGiven the association of polymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene region with susceptibility to SLE as well as the potential common alterations in immune function and related genes between SLE and SSc, the current study sought to determine if polymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene region are associated with SSc susceptibility in a large case-control study of North American Caucasian patients with SSc and healthy controls.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: Methods\nPatients with SSc and controls\nA total of 1059 Caucasian patients with SSc and 698 healthy Caucasian controls from the Scleroderma Family Registry and DNA Repository and the University of Texas Rheumatology Division, dating from 1986 to present, including the Genetics versus Environment in Scleroderma Outcomes Study (GENISOS) formed the current cohort. All patients with SSc fulfilled American College of Rheumatology (ACR) preliminary criteria for disease classification or had at least three of the five CREST (for \u2018Calcinosis, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, Eesophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasias') features. Patients were not excluded if they had symptoms of myositis or Sjogren's syndrome. Patients in the registry were excluded if they met ACR criteria for SLE. In the division samples, one patient",
		" pg/ml) compared with HC (15.6; 3.7\u201332.3 pg/ ml) (p < 0.0001). In children with AD, sOX40 levels were comparable with adult AD levels (9.7; 2.0\u201324.6 pg/ml) (Fig. 1A). Regarding sOX40L, no significant differences were observed between the groups (Fig. 1B).\nSerum levels of sOX40 is associated with atopic comorbidities and in children with disease activity\nSignificantly different levels of serum sOX40 were observed between the groups; therefore we examined the association between the individual serum sOX40 level, the SCORAD index, and other markers related to atopic disease activity. In the group of adults with AD, the patients with asthma had significant higher sOX40 serum levels (10.0; range 4.0\u201312.8 pg/ml), compared with those without asthma (7.0; 4.6\u201310.2 pg/ml) (p < 0.01). In children, sOX40 correlated with SCORAD (\u03c1 = 0.404, p < 0.01) (Table II). Soluble OX40L showed no association with disease activity measurements, either in children or in adults.\nOX40 and OX40L are highly expressed by skin-homing T cells and monocytes in atopic dermatitis\nConsidering the reduced sOX40 serum levels in patients with AD, we investigated the surface expression of OX40 and its ligand on PBMCs from adult patients with AD. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs from adult patients with AD (n = 11) and HC (n = 10) revealed that OX40 was mainly expressed by skin-homing memory-prone CLA+ T cells, in both AD patients and HC (Fig. 2A and B).\nIn adult patients with AD, 8.9% (6.8\u201314.2%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells expressed OX40 followed by 4.6% (3.4\u20136.6%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells. OX40 expression in AD patients was less pronounced on CD8+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells (0.5%; 0.0\u20132.6%) and CD8+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells (0.7%; 0.4\u20131.3%)). No differences were observed compared with HC (Fig. 2A).\nA similar pattern emerged when the results were evaluated using median fluorescence intensity (MFI), although with important differences: CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells from patients with AD expressed the highest amount of OX40 per cell (MFI 287 (244\u2013317)), and revealed a significantly higher level than HC (MFI 235; range 215\u2013275) (p < 0.05). CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells expressed a lower amount of OX40 (MFI 246; range 238\u2013299), but also significantly higher than HC (MFI 214 (206\u2013231)) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern was observed for the CD8+ T cells, but to a lesser degree than by CD4+ T cells. In general, monocytes expressed high levels of OX40L both in percentage (64.1%; range 8.1\u201392.1%) and MFI (1964; range 244\u20133649) (Fig. 2C and D), but no differences were observed between AD and HC (all p > 0.05).\nCellular expression of OX40 in patients with atopic dermatitis inversely correlates with SCORAD\nTo further evaluate OX40 in AD, the relative cell populations were correlated with disease activity (SCORAD) and serum IgE. The percentage of CD4+CD45RO+OX40+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells correlated inversely with disease activity measured by SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.809, p < 0.01) and CLA\u2212 (\u03c1 = \u22120.782, p < 0.01)). Similarly, the MFI also correlated with SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.709, p < 0.1) and CLA- (\u03c1 = \u22120.674, p < 0.05)), but not with serum IgE levels. No correlations with disease activity and serum IgE for OX40 expressed by CD8+CD45RO+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells or OX40L expressed by monocytes were observed. Individual plasma levels of sOX40 and sOX40L did not correlate with surface expression of OX40 and OX40L (data not shown).\nOX40 and OX40L are co-localized in atopic dermatitis\nTo confirm the involvement of OX40-OX40L interactions directly in the skin, immunofluorescence staining was carried out on involved and uninvolved skin biopsies from adult patients with AD and from HC. OX40- and OX40L-expressing cells were identified in both involved and uninvolved tissue (not shown) and found to be co-localized within the dermis (Fig. 3A). In AD skin, in particular, OX40-positive staining was present on the surface of OX40L-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). That these were indeed OX40L-expressing mast cells were confirmed by positive tryptase staining (Fig. ",
		"Section Type: TITLE\nText: The OX40 Axis is Associated with Both Systemic and Local Involvement in Atopic Dermatitis\n\nSection Type: ABSTRACT\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis, and is dominated by Th2 cells. The co-stimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD, as their interactions are crucial for the generation of TH2 memory cells. Using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and flow cytometry on blood samples from patients with AD and healthy volunteers, this study shows that the serum level of soluble (s) OX40 is decreased in patients with AD, and the expression of OX40 by activated skin-homing CD4+ T cells is increased. This study further shows, using immunofluorescence on skin biopsies, that OX40+ and OX40L+ cells are co-located within the dermis, indicating local activity of OX40/OX40L. Serum levels of sOX40 were associated with atopic diseases and, together, these results support that the OX40 system is important for chronic inflammation in AD skin.\n\nSection Type: INTRO\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 20% of children and may persist into adulthood. The symptoms are eczema, intense pruritus, and dry skin, caused by a profound skin inflammation and epidermal barrier dysfunction. Up to 80% of patients with AD have elevated levels of IgE. Furthermore, development of memory T cells is believed to be central for chronicity in AD.\nOX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are both members of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily and are important regulators of the immune response. The OX40 system is required for generating a long-term memory response and optimal T-cell activation. The OX40-OX40L axis is considered to be involved in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including allergic asthma.\nT-cell expression of OX40 and antigen-presenting cells (APC) expression of OX40L appear within 2\u20133 days after antigen-activation. The signal through OX40 enhances T-cell clonal expansion and, especially, survival of TH2 cells. Apart from APC, OX40L is also expressed by mast cells. Both OX40 and OX40L also exist in soluble forms. Soluble OX40 (sOX40) has an anti-inflammatory effect when binding to the membrane-bound form of OX40L. sOX40 is able to mimic regulatory T-cell function, inhibit mast cell degranulation and thereby reduce the inflammatory response.\nSIGNIFICANCE\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease dominated by Th2 cells. The costimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are crucial for the generation of Th2 memory cells, and may thus play a central role in the pathogenesis and chronicity of atopic dermatitis. This study shows that OX40 expression is increased on skin-homing T cells in patients with atopic dermatitis, and that OX40 and OX40L cells are colocalized in the skin. These findings indicate that the OX40 system could play a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction of atopic dermatitis in the skin.\nNot only are mast cells implicated in the immediate hypersensitivity reactions, but also in the production of TH2 driving cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-25, and hence central mediators of AD pathogenesis.\nFurthermore, IgE-activated mast cells have been shown to interact with T cells through expression of OX40L, suggesting a sophisticated interplay between these immune cells mediated by IgE and OX40L.\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the OX40/ OX40L axis in AD, including the OX40 expressing cells and the correlation between serum levels and disease-specific markers.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: MATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatient samples\nPatients with AD were diagnosed using the Hanifin & Rajka criteria. None of the patients were receiving systemic immune suppressive therapy at the time of sample collection. All patients were assessed by use of the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD) and measurement of total IgE serum level.\nSerum samples from 67 adults (age 30; range 24\u201342 years), and 60 children with AD (age 8; 3\u201314 years) were collected at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. Clinical parameters were acquired at the time of blood collection: SCORAD, total serum IgE and the presence of asthma and/or rhinitis (Table I). Serum samples were also obtained from 31 healthy controls (HC) (age 39; 28\u201351 years) matched for age and sex with the adult AD group. The controls had no history of AD or other systemic inflammatory diseases. All adult patients with AD and HC gave their written informed consent. The parents provided written consent on behalf of their children with AD. For ethical reasons serum samples from healthy children were not included.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were collected from 11 adult patients with AD (age 29; 21\u201343 years) and 10 age- and sex-matched HC (age 27; 24\u201333 years) with no atopic diseases or systemic inflammatory diseases (Table I).

These associations were similar when comparing lSSc and dSSc with controls. We also identified particular SNPs in the TNFSF4 gene region that are associated with the SSc-associated autoantibody subsets of SSc. Lastly, the exploratory method of analysis, CART, demonstrated a potential interaction between the TNFSF4 SNPs rs2205960 and rs855648 among Caucasian women patients with SSc that was confirmed by logistic regression analysis.\nTNFSF4 encodes for the protein OX40 ligand (OX40L). OX40L is expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells as well as non-immune cells such as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. It is the ligand for the OX40 which is expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, where it provides a costimulatory signal resulting in T cell proliferation, survival and cytokine production. Several studies have suggested that OX40\u2013OX40L interaction may preferentially promote T helper (Th)2 cytokines and may be a negative regulatory signal for interleukin (IL)17 production. More recently it has been suggested that OX40\u2013OX40L interactions inhibit the formation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. In addition to T cell effects, OX40\u2013OX40L interactions also have been reported to be critical in differentiation of B cells and antibody production. Lastly, it has been reported that plasmacytoid dendritic cells may regulate T helper responses through a balance of OX40L expression and type I interferon expression such that OX40L alone induces a Th2 response and OX40L with type I interferon may have a Th1 inducing effect. Together these studies suggest an important role for OX40\u2013OX40L interactions in critical immunoregulatory checkpoints that are likely involved in the development of autoimmunity. Accordingly, OX40L transgenic mice on the C57/BL6 background develop organ specific inflammation and targeted strategies to block OX40\u2013OX40L interactions have prevented the development of diabetes in the non-obese diabetic mouse and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis. It is likely that these pathways and OX40L-dependent immune alterations are important in the development of SSc. Indeed serum levels of OX40 have been reported to be elevated in patients with SSc, suggesting that the OX40\u2013OX40L pathway may be involved in SSc. However, specifically how the OX40L polymorphisms lead to the development of SSc is unknown.\nThe current report adds TNFSF4 to the list of genes that are associated with SSc susceptibility which includes major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, PTPN22, AIF1, IRF5, STAT4 and FAS. Furthermore, given the association of TNFSF4 with SLE as well as SSc, it is likely that TNFSF4 is a gene that confers risk to multiple autoimmune diseases. Why individual patients will develop a specific autoimmune disease such as SLE, RA, or SSc remains unknown. Functional studies of the polymorphisms in these genes as well as studies of gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interactions are necessary to better understand how the genetic associations lead to specific autoimmune diseases.\nOur study, despite its large size, is limited to the North American Caucasian population. Current efforts are underway to confirm these findings in other populations. However, we believe that the prior association of TNFSF4 with SLE and the emerging concepts of shared autoimmune genes provide some validation of our novel findings in SSc.

The most upregulated genes in skin were associated with B cell responses, including immunoglobulin genes such as IGLV3-27 (100-fold increased, adjusted P = 2.74 \u00d7 10\u20135), CD19 (33-fold, adjusted P = 6.48 \u00d7 10\u201324), and CD79a (32-fold, adjusted P = 3.58 \u00d7 10\u201322). Other genes included the antimicrobial gene DEFB4A (24-fold, adjusted P = 2.71 \u00d7 10\u201310); CXCL13, a B cell chemoattractant (16-fold, adjusted P = 1.25 \u00d7 10\u20138); and the neutrophil chemokine CXCL1 (2.8-fold, adjusted P = 2.91 \u00d7 10\u20132). In the WB, there were 332 DEGs, of which 230 were increased and 102 decreased (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).\nHS shows a complex inflammatory profile distinct from that of psoriasis or atopic dermatitis and enriched in genes involved in B cell function.\nTo address the major transcriptomic characteristics of HS, we compared it with RNA-Seq data from psoriasis (n = 28) and atopic dermatitis (AD) (n = 32) because the inflammatory responses in these 2 diseases are well characterized, and many of the drugs currently approved for these diseases are currently being repurposed for treatment of HS. Interestingly, genes dysregulated in lesional skin for all 3 diseases included the antimicrobial genes DEFB4A, SPRR2F, CD177, and TCN1. In terms of expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes in HS, we observed increased mRNA expression of IFNG (2.6-fold, adjusted P = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u20132), IL17A (8.6-fold, adjusted P = 6.7 \u00d7 10\u20137), IL17F (13.3-fold, adjusted P = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u20139), IL36A (9-fold, adjusted P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u20134), and IL36G (2.4-fold, adjusted P = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u20132) compared with healthy controls, whereas IL13 and IL17C expression were overall decreased (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 2). Notably, the elevation of IL17A and IL17F expression in HS was comparable to the expression levels in psoriatic skin. With regard to the magnitude of the cytokine response in HS skin, we observed significant responses for stimulation of type II IFN (i.e., IFN-\u03b3; P = 5.9 \u00d7 10\u20135) and IL-36 (P = 9.3 \u00d7 10\u20134) in HS lesional skin, whereas the effect of Th2 response (i.e., IL-4), IL-17A, or TNF stimulation was absent in HS skin (Figure 1C). These data demonstrate lack of a dominant Th cytokine axis in HS, in contrast to AD (Th2) or psoriasis (Th17). To address the unique inflammatory responses in HS, we compared HS with either psoriasis or AD and found that the most prominent genes unique to HS included genes encoding immunoglobulins (Figure 1D). Using bulk RNA-Seq data from HS skin, we interrogated for cell type\u2013specific signatures. For HS skin the top 3 cell signatures were assigned to B cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201340), followed by various T cell populations, including Th2, and CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201312) (Figure 1E). In contrast, cell type signatures in blood included CD4+ naive cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201320), Th17 cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201315), and Th2 cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201312) (Figure 1E). Biological processes enriched among increased DEGs in HS skin included immune response (adjusted P = 7.64 \u00d7 10\u201384), regulation of immune response (adjusted P = 8.26 \u00d7 10\u201382), complement activation (adjusted P = 2.09 \u00d7 10\u201356), Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway (FDR = 8.86 \u00d7 10\u201341), innate immune response (FDR = 4.92 \u00d7 10\u201333), B cell receptor signaling (FDR = 2.32 \u00d7 10\u201323), and neutrophil chemotaxis (FDR 8.75 \u00d7 10\u201311). Biological processes enriched among decreased DEGs included PPAR signaling pathway (adjusted P = 3.17 \u00d7 10\u20137) and steroid biosynthesis (adjusted P = 0.008). KEGG pathways among decreased DEGs included cholesterol biosynthetic process (adjusted P = 9.64 \u00d7 10\u201311) and lipid metabolic process (adjusted P = 5.5 \u00d7 10\u20134) (Figure 1F).\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing outlines the cellular composition of HS.\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was performed on cells isolated from 9 excisional samples from patients with severe HS. We collected 30,636 cells with a median 1974 genes and a median 7342 transcripts. We did unsupervised clustering analysis and grouped the cells into 22 clusters (Figure 2A), which were further annotated as 10 cell types including keratinocytes, melanocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, B cells, plasma",

		"Section Type: TITLE\nText: The OX40 Axis is Associated with Both Systemic and Local Involvement in Atopic Dermatitis\n\nSection Type: ABSTRACT\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis, and is dominated by Th2 cells. The co-stimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD, as their interactions are crucial for the generation of TH2 memory cells. Using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and flow cytometry on blood samples from patients with AD and healthy volunteers, this study shows that the serum level of soluble (s) OX40 is decreased in patients with AD, and the expression of OX40 by activated skin-homing CD4+ T cells is increased. This study further shows, using immunofluorescence on skin biopsies, that OX40+ and OX40L+ cells are co-located within the dermis, indicating local activity of OX40/OX40L. Serum levels of sOX40 were associated with atopic diseases and, together, these results support that the OX40 system is important for chronic inflammation in AD skin.\n\nSection Type: INTRO\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 20% of children and may persist into adulthood. The symptoms are eczema, intense pruritus, and dry skin, caused by a profound skin inflammation and epidermal barrier dysfunction. Up to 80% of patients with AD have elevated levels of IgE. Furthermore, development of memory T cells is believed to be central for chronicity in AD.\nOX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are both members of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily and are important regulators of the immune response. The OX40 system is required for generating a long-term memory response and optimal T-cell activation. The OX40-OX40L axis is considered to be involved in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including allergic asthma.\nT-cell expression of OX40 and antigen-presenting cells (APC) expression of OX40L appear within 2\u20133 days after antigen-activation. The signal through OX40 enhances T-cell clonal expansion and, especially, survival of TH2 cells. Apart from APC, OX40L is also expressed by mast cells. Both OX40 and OX40L also exist in soluble forms. Soluble OX40 (sOX40) has an anti-inflammatory effect when binding to the membrane-bound form of OX40L. sOX40 is able to mimic regulatory T-cell function, inhibit mast cell degranulation and thereby reduce the inflammatory response.\nSIGNIFICANCE\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease dominated by Th2 cells. The costimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are crucial for the generation of Th2 memory cells, and may thus play a central role in the pathogenesis and chronicity of atopic dermatitis. This study shows that OX40 expression is increased on skin-homing T cells in patients with atopic dermatitis, and that OX40 and OX40L cells are colocalized in the skin. These findings indicate that the OX40 system could play a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction of atopic dermatitis in the skin.\nNot only are mast cells implicated in the immediate hypersensitivity reactions, but also in the production of TH2 driving cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-25, and hence central mediators of AD pathogenesis.\nFurthermore, IgE-activated mast cells have been shown to interact with T cells through expression of OX40L, suggesting a sophisticated interplay between these immune cells mediated by IgE and OX40L.\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the OX40/ OX40L axis in AD, including the OX40 expressing cells and the correlation between serum levels and disease-specific markers.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: MATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatient samples\nPatients with AD were diagnosed using the Hanifin & Rajka criteria. None of the patients were receiving systemic immune suppressive therapy at the time of sample collection. All patients were assessed by use of the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD) and measurement of total IgE serum level.\nSerum samples from 67 adults (age 30; range 24\u201342 years), and 60 children with AD (age 8; 3\u201314 years) were collected at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. Clinical parameters were acquired at the time of blood collection: SCORAD, total serum IgE and the presence of asthma and/or rhinitis (Table I). Serum samples were also obtained from 31 healthy controls (HC) (age 39; 28\u201351 years) matched for age and sex with the adult AD group. The controls had no history of AD or other systemic inflammatory diseases. All adult patients with AD and HC gave their written informed consent. The parents provided written consent on behalf of their children with AD. For ethical reasons serum samples from healthy children were not included.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were collected from 11 adult patients with AD (age 29; 21\u201343 years) and 10 age- and sex-matched HC (age 27; 24\u201333 years) with no atopic diseases or systemic inflammatory diseases (Table I). The PBMCs were isolated",
		"- and OX40L-expressing cells were identified in both involved and uninvolved tissue (not shown) and found to be co-localized within the dermis (Fig. 3A). In AD skin, in particular, OX40-positive staining was present on the surface of OX40L-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). That these were indeed OX40L-expressing mast cells were confirmed by positive tryptase staining (Fig. 3B).\n\nSection Type: FIG\nText: Decreased serum levels of sOX40, but not sOX40L, in atopic dermatitis (AD). Serum levels of soluble (s)OX40 and sOX40L were measured in patients with AD (adults n = 67 and children n = 60) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 31) matched for age and sex with AD adults, by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). (a) In adult patients with AD, serum levels of sOX40 were significantly decreased compared with HC. In children with AD, serum level of sOX40 showed similar levels as in adults with AD. (b) Serum levels of soluble OX40L showed no significant differences between the patients with AD and HC. Data are analysed by Mann-Whitney U test.

(a) Skin biopsies from involved (n = 5) and uninvolved skin (n = 5) from patients with AD were examined for the presence of OX40 (red) and OX40L (green) and compared with healthy controls (n = 5). Nuclear staining was carried out by DAPI (blue). OX40- and OX40L-positive cells were present in involved and uninvolved AD skin. (b) The presence of OX40L (green) co-expressed with tryptase (red) confirmed these to be mast cells, located to the dermis of patients with AD. Original magnification \u00d740.\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: DISCUSSION\nThe results of this study show that children and adults with AD have reduced serum levels of sOX40 compared with adult HC. Although the patients in the study cohort were included based on their presentation of AD, some patients also had allergic rhinitis and asthma. This subsequently made it possible to examine the association of serum levels of sOX40 and sOX40L and atopic comorbidities in patients with AD.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated elevated sOX40L levels in patients with active allergic asthma. This was further supported by Farres et al., who showed that increased expression of OX40L on B cells is associated with the level of total IgE in allergic asthma patients. These findings are in line with murine asthma models, in which OX40L is highly expressed by a variety of cells within the lung during an induced allergic reaction. Although, in general, decreased serum levels were observed in AD, adults with concomitant asthma had the highest levels of serum sOX40. As with all members of the TNF-super family, sOX40 can bind to its ligand expressed by different cell types. This may explain the decrease in serum levels of sOX40. However, in our experiments we observed similar levels of sOX40L in healthy volunteers and patients with AD and, thus, circulating sOX40L is not an appropriate marker of disease activity in AD.\nMore interestingly, focusing on circulating skin-homing CD4+ T cells from patients with AD we observed an increase in expression of OX40. As skin-homing T cells are able to upregulate OX40 expression, an increased number of pathogenic T cells can migrate to the inflammatory site of the skin and thereby enhance local inflammation.\nIn addition, this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness",
		" pg/ml) compared with HC (15.6; 3.7\u201332.3 pg/ ml) (p < 0.0001). In children with AD, sOX40 levels were comparable with adult AD levels (9.7; 2.0\u201324.6 pg/ml) (Fig. 1A). Regarding sOX40L, no significant differences were observed between the groups (Fig. 1B).\nSerum levels of sOX40 is associated with atopic comorbidities and in children with disease activity\nSignificantly different levels of serum sOX40 were observed between the groups; therefore we examined the association between the individual serum sOX40 level, the SCORAD index, and other markers related to atopic disease activity. In the group of adults with AD, the patients with asthma had significant higher sOX40 serum levels (10.0; range 4.0\u201312.8 pg/ml), compared with those without asthma (7.0; 4.6\u201310.2 pg/ml) (p < 0.01). In children, sOX40 correlated with SCORAD (\u03c1 = 0.404, p < 0.01) (Table II). Soluble OX40L showed no association with disease activity measurements, either in children or in adults.\nOX40 and OX40L are highly expressed by skin-homing T cells and monocytes in atopic dermatitis\nConsidering the reduced sOX40 serum levels in patients with AD, we investigated the surface expression of OX40 and its ligand on PBMCs from adult patients with AD. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs from adult patients with AD (n = 11) and HC (n = 10) revealed that OX40 was mainly expressed by skin-homing memory-prone CLA+ T cells, in both AD patients and HC (Fig. 2A and B).\nIn adult patients with AD, 8.9% (6.8\u201314.2%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells expressed OX40 followed by 4.6% (3.4\u20136.6%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells. OX40 expression in AD patients was less pronounced on CD8+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells (0.5%; 0.0\u20132.6%) and CD8+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells (0.7%; 0.4\u20131.3%)). No differences were observed compared with HC (Fig. 2A).\nA similar pattern emerged when the results were evaluated using median fluorescence intensity (MFI), although with important differences: CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells from patients with AD expressed the highest amount of OX40 per cell (MFI 287 (244\u2013317)), and revealed a significantly higher level than HC (MFI 235; range 215\u2013275) (p < 0.05). CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells expressed a lower amount of OX40 (MFI 246; range 238\u2013299), but also significantly higher than HC (MFI 214 (206\u2013231)) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern was observed for the CD8+ T cells, but to a lesser degree than by CD4+ T cells. In general, monocytes expressed high levels of OX40L both in percentage (64.1%; range 8.1\u201392.1%) and MFI (1964; range 244\u20133649) (Fig. 2C and D), but no differences were observed between AD and HC (all p > 0.05).\nCellular expression of OX40 in patients with atopic dermatitis inversely correlates with SCORAD\nTo further evaluate OX40 in AD, the relative cell populations were correlated with disease activity (SCORAD) and serum IgE. The percentage of CD4+CD45RO+OX40+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells correlated inversely with disease activity measured by SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.809, p < 0.01) and CLA\u2212 (\u03c1 = \u22120.782, p < 0.01)). Similarly, the MFI also correlated with SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.709, p < 0.1) and CLA- (\u03c1 = \u22120.674, p < 0.05)), but not with serum IgE levels. No correlations with disease activity and serum IgE for OX40 expressed by CD8+CD45RO+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells or OX40L expressed by monocytes were observed. Individual plasma levels of sOX40 and sOX40L did not correlate with surface expression of OX40 and OX40L (data not shown).\nOX40 and OX40L are co-localized in atopic dermatitis\nTo confirm the involvement of OX40-OX40L interactions directly in the skin, immunofluorescence staining was carried out on involved and uninvolved skin biopsies from adult patients with AD and from HC. OX40- and OX40L-expressing cells were identified in both involved and uninvolved tissue (not shown) and found to be co-localized within the dermis (Fig. 3A). In AD skin, in particular, OX40-positive staining was present on the surface of OX40L-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). That these were indeed OX40L-expressing mast cells were confirmed by positive tryptase staining (Fig. ",
		" this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness when used as treatment for AD.\nTogether, these findings indicate a close correlation between the OX40 system and atopic diseases.\nIn conclusion, OX40 expression is increased on skinhoming T cells and, together with our finding that OX40 and OX40L are co-localized in the skin, the OX40-OX40L system may play an important role in the recruitment to and activation of these cells in the skin. This finding is supported by the association of disease activity and atopic co-morbidities in atopic dermatitis, and we hypothesize that the OX40 system plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction in the skin. It is therefore of interest to follow the development of AD treatments targeting the OX40 system.\n The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. \n\nSection Type: REF\nText: REFERENCES\nAtopic dermatitis\nNew insights into atopic dermatitis\nThe role of TNF superfamily members in T-cell function and diseases\nOX40 promotes Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression and is essential for long-term survival of CD4 T cells\nThe OX40 costimulatory receptor determines the development of CD4 memory by regulating primary clonal expansion\nOX40-OX40 ligand interaction in T-cell-mediated immunity and immunopathology\nSoluble OX40L is associated with presence of autoantibodies in early rheumatoid arthritis\nSOX40L: an important inflammatory mediator in adult bronchial asthma\nInterruption of the OX40-OX40 ligand pathway in LDL receptor-deficient mice causes regression of atherosclerosis\nControl of immunity by the TNFR-related molecule OX40 (CD134)\nCritical role for OX40 ligand in the development of pathogenic Th2 cells in a murine model of asthma\nT cell proliferation by direct cross-talk between OX40 ligand on human mast cells and OX40 on human T cells: comparison of gene expression profiles between human tonsillar and lung-cultured mast cells\nTechnical advance: soluble OX40 molecule mimics regulatory T cell modulatory activity on FcepsilonRI-dependent mast cell degranulation\nMast cells produce interleukin-25 upon Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation\nMast cells enhance T cell activation: importance of mast cell costimulatory molecules and secreted TNF\nDiagnostic features of atopic dermatitis\nA simple set of validation steps identifies and removes false results in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay caused by anti-animal IgG antibodies in plasma from arthritis patients\nSerum OX40 ligand levels in asthmatic children: a potential biomarker of severity and persistence\nOX40 ligand: a potential costimulatory molecule in atopic asthma\nThe upregulated expression of OX40/OX40L and their promotion of T cells proliferation in the murine model of asthma\nCrucial role of OX40/OX40L signaling in a murine model of asthma\nGBR 830, an anti-OX40, improves skin gene signatures and clinical scores in patients with atopic dermatitis\n"

(a) Skin biopsies from involved (n = 5) and uninvolved skin (n = 5) from patients with AD were examined for the presence of OX40 (red) and OX40L (green) and compared with healthy controls (n = 5). Nuclear staining was carried out by DAPI (blue). OX40- and OX40L-positive cells were present in involved and uninvolved AD skin. (b) The presence of OX40L (green) co-expressed with tryptase (red) confirmed these to be mast cells, located to the dermis of patients with AD. Original magnification \u00d740.\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: DISCUSSION\nThe results of this study show that children and adults with AD have reduced serum levels of sOX40 compared with adult HC. Although the patients in the study cohort were included based on their presentation of AD, some patients also had allergic rhinitis and asthma. This subsequently made it possible to examine the association of serum levels of sOX40 and sOX40L and atopic comorbidities in patients with AD.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated elevated sOX40L levels in patients with active allergic asthma. This was further supported by Farres et al., who showed that increased expression of OX40L on B cells is associated with the level of total IgE in allergic asthma patients. These findings are in line with murine asthma models, in which OX40L is highly expressed by a variety of cells within the lung during an induced allergic reaction. Although, in general, decreased serum levels were observed in AD, adults with concomitant asthma had the highest levels of serum sOX40. As with all members of the TNF-super family, sOX40 can bind to its ligand expressed by different cell types. This may explain the decrease in serum levels of sOX40. However, in our experiments we observed similar levels of sOX40L in healthy volunteers and patients with AD and, thus, circulating sOX40L is not an appropriate marker of disease activity in AD.\nMore interestingly, focusing on circulating skin-homing CD4+ T cells from patients with AD we observed an increase in expression of OX40. As skin-homing T cells are able to upregulate OX40 expression, an increased number of pathogenic T cells can migrate to the inflammatory site of the skin and thereby enhance local inflammation.\nIn addition, this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness",
		" pg/ml) compared with HC (15.6; 3.7\u201332.3 pg/ ml) (p < 0.0001). In children with AD, sOX40 levels were comparable with adult AD levels (9.7; 2.0\u201324.6 pg/ml) (Fig. 1A). Regarding sOX40L, no significant differences were observed between the groups (Fig. 1B).\nSerum levels of sOX40 is associated with atopic comorbidities and in children with disease activity\nSignificantly different levels of serum sOX40 were observed between the groups; therefore we examined the association between the individual serum sOX40 level, the SCORAD index, and other markers related to atopic disease activity. In the group of adults with AD, the patients with asthma had significant higher sOX40 serum levels (10.0; range 4.0\u201312.8 pg/ml), compared with those without asthma (7.0; 4.6\u201310.2 pg/ml) (p < 0.01). In children, sOX40 correlated with SCORAD (\u03c1 = 0.404, p < 0.01) (Table II). Soluble OX40L showed no association with disease activity measurements, either in children or in adults.\nOX40 and OX40L are highly expressed by skin-homing T cells and monocytes in atopic dermatitis\nConsidering the reduced sOX40 serum levels in patients with AD, we investigated the surface expression of OX40 and its ligand on PBMCs from adult patients with AD. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs from adult patients with AD (n = 11) and HC (n = 10) revealed that OX40 was mainly expressed by skin-homing memory-prone CLA+ T cells, in both AD patients and HC (Fig. 2A and B).\nIn adult patients with AD, 8.9% (6.8\u201314.2%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells expressed OX40 followed by 4.6% (3.4\u20136.6%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells. OX40 expression in AD patients was less pronounced on CD8+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells (0.5%; 0.0\u20132.6%) and CD8+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells (0.7%; 0.4\u20131.3%)). No differences were observed compared with HC (Fig. 2A).\nA similar pattern emerged when the results were evaluated using median fluorescence intensity (MFI), although with important differences: CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells from patients with AD expressed the highest amount of OX40 per cell (MFI 287 (244\u2013317)), and revealed a significantly higher level than HC (MFI 235; range 215\u2013275) (p < 0.05). CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells expressed a lower amount of OX40 (MFI 246; range 238\u2013299), but also significantly higher than HC (MFI 214 (206\u2013231)) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern was observed for the CD8+ T cells, but to a lesser degree than by CD4+ T cells. In general, monocytes expressed high levels of OX40L both in percentage (64.1%; range 8.1\u201392.1%) and MFI (1964; range 244\u20133649) (Fig. 2C and D), but no differences were observed between AD and HC (all p > 0.05).\nCellular expression of OX40 in patients with atopic dermatitis inversely correlates with SCORAD\nTo further evaluate OX40 in AD, the relative cell populations were correlated with disease activity (SCORAD) and serum IgE. The percentage of CD4+CD45RO+OX40+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells correlated inversely with disease activity measured by SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.809, p < 0.01) and CLA\u2212 (\u03c1 = \u22120.782, p < 0.01)). Similarly, the MFI also correlated with SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.709, p < 0.1) and CLA- (\u03c1 = \u22120.674, p < 0.05)), but not with serum IgE levels. No correlations with disease activity and serum IgE for OX40 expressed by CD8+CD45RO+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells or OX40L expressed by monocytes were observed. Individual plasma levels of sOX40 and sOX40L did not correlate with surface expression of OX40 and OX40L (data not shown).\nOX40 and OX40L are co-localized in atopic dermatitis\nTo confirm the involvement of OX40-OX40L interactions directly in the skin, immunofluorescence staining was carried out on involved and uninvolved skin biopsies from adult patients with AD and from HC. OX40- and OX40L-expressing cells were identified in both involved and uninvolved tissue (not shown) and found to be co-localized within the dermis (Fig. 3A). In AD skin, in particular, OX40-positive staining was present on the surface of OX40L-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). That these were indeed OX40L-expressing mast cells were confirmed by positive tryptase staining (Fig. ",
		" markers.\nRNA-sequencing.\nSkin biopsies of 4 mm in diameter were taken, placed in tubes with RNAlater (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific), stored overnight at 4\u00b0C, and subsequently stored at \u201380\u00b0C until further processing. RNA isolation and sequencing were performed using the Illumina NextSeq platform and sequencing protocols as previously described. For RNA-Seq analyses, adapter trimming and quality control were conducted on the raw sequence reads. The paired-end reads were mapped using STAR to human build GRCh37, and only uniquely mapped reads were used for subsequent analysis. RNA-Seq data from psoriasis and AD were obtained. Gene expression levels were quantified (GENCODE v24 was used as reference) and normalized by HTSeq and DESeq2, respectively. Negative binomial model in DESeq2 were used to conduct differential expression analysis.\nTCR/BCR analyses.\nMiXCR software was used to extract TCR and BCR CDR3 sequences from RNA-Seq data. Analysis was performed with the \u201c-p rna-seq\u201d option recommended for analysis of RNA-Seq data. Data visualization and TCR repertoire comparison were performed in R. The CDR3 region was defined according to the International ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) nomenclature. Likewise, gene names of V and J regions were defined according to the IMGT name nomenclature for TCRs of mice as previously described. Clone abundances across samples were plotted using the \u201cpheatmap\u201d R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pheatmap/index.html). The heatmap was constructed using Euclidean distance with complete linkage on centered data using the top clones showing greatest variance. Alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the Shannon diversity index using the vegan software package in R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html). The Shannon diversity index quantifies diversity through the incorporation of both evenness and richness, with higher values representing more even populations of TCR- or BCR-rich samples. The differences in beta diversity were assessed based on Jaccard distances calculated using the vegan software package in R. To visualize the Jaccard dissimilarities between the samples, PCoA using R package ape was performed.\nCyTOF imaging.\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue slides obtained from HS patients and healthy controls were heated for 2 hours at 60\u00b0C, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. Slides were placed in pH 9 Tris/EDTA antigen retrieval buffer and heated at 96\u00b0C for 30 minutes. After cooling, slides were blocked in 3% BSA and stained with a cocktail of metal-tagged antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C, including CD14 (EPR3653, Abcam), CD16 (EPR16784, Abcam), CD68 (KP1, BioLegend), CD15 (W6D3, Fluidigm), CD31 (JC/70A, Novus), CD45 (2B11, Novus), E-Cadherin (24E10, Fluidigm), CD20 (L26, Novus), CD8 (C8/144B, Fluidigm), collagen (polyclonal, Fluidigm), CD27 (EPR8569, Abcam), CD103 [EPR4166, Abcam], CD138 (MI15, BioLegend), and pan-actin (D18C11, Cell Signaling Technology). The slides were then washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 and stained with Intercalator-Ir (Fluidigm) for 30 minutes at room temperature in a hydration chamber. The stained tissue was ablated and raw data were acquired on the Hyperion Imaging System (Fluidigm).\nCyTOF imaging data analysis.\nMultiplexed CyTOF imaging data were preprocessed using commercial acquisition software (Fluidigm) and converted to.TIFF images. These images were then segmented into individual cells using CellProfiler v3.1.8 for single-cell analysis. The t-SNE dimensionality reduction algorithm and the Phenograph unsupervised clustering algorithm were performed on 12 markers (CD20, CD15, CD27, CD68, CD16, CD14, CD138, CD31, CD103, CD45, CD3, and CD8) using HistoCAT v1.75 software. For t-SNE and Phenograph, the data were normalized to the 99th percentile. The heatmap shows Z-scored mean marker expression of each cluster. P values were computed using 2-tailed Student\u2019s t tests assuming homoscedasticity.\nImmunohistochemistry.\nParaffin-embedded tissue sections from excisional biopsies from patients with hidradenitis and healthy control skin were heated at 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. Slides were placed in pH 6 antigen retrieval buffer and heated at 125\u00b0C for 30 seconds in a pressure cooker water bath. After cooling, slides were treated with 3% H2O2 (5 minutes) and blocked using 10% goat serum (30 minutes). Overnight incubation (4\u00b0C) was performed using CR1 (CD35) (LifeSpan Biosciences, catalog LS-C675585, 5 \u03bcg/mL) and CR2 (CD21) (LifeSpan Biosciences, catalog LS-C167018, concentration 1:50). Staining done in antigen retrieval buffer at pH 9 included IgG1 (Abcam, catalog ab233885, 5 \u03bcg/mL), phospho-SYK (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog C87C1, 1:100), phospho-BTK (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog 14-9015-82, ",
		"621) (https://www.genomatix.de). The function-word level was used as the minimum evidence level parameter. We ran CellPhoneDB using all the cell types with the default parameters. For all single-group comparisons, if data passed normality test, we used 2-tailed Student\u2019s t test. Otherwise data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. All data are representative of at least 2 independent experiments as detailed in the figure legends. A P value of less than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. For all data related to the RNA-Seq analyses, a threshold of FDR \u2264 0.1 was used for significance.\nStudy approval.\nTwenty-two patients with moderate-to-severe HS undergoing surgery were recruited from the specialized HS outpatient clinic of the Department of Dermatology, Erasmus University Medical Center (Erasmus MC), Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Patients were off any topical or systemic treatment at least 2 weeks before enrollment. Biopsies from lesional skin and blood samples were collected during routine HS surgery. Ten healthy controls were recruited from patients undergoing surgery for skin cancer or abdominoplasty. All samples were obtained with written informed consent from the participants in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki principles. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Erasmus MC (MEC-2013-337).

For ethical reasons serum samples from healthy children were not included.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were collected from 11 adult patients with AD (age 29; 21\u201343 years) and 10 age- and sex-matched HC (age 27; 24\u201333 years) with no atopic diseases or systemic inflammatory diseases (Table I). The PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare Europe, Br\u00f8ndby, Denmark) density gradient centrifugation and frozen at \u2212135\u00b0C until analysis.\nParaffin-embedded biopsies were collected from involved and uninvolved skin from 5 patients with AD and skin biopsies were collected from 5 HC. Written consent was obtained in accordance with the guidelines of the Danish National Ethics Committee for Health Research and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nDetection of sOX40 and sOX40L by ELISA\nSoluble OX40 and sOX40L were measured in serum from patients with AD and from HC with a sOX40 ELISA kit (cat. no. BMS296TEN, eBioscience (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA)) and with an inhouse sOX40L ELISA, as described previously. OD values were read by a Thermo Scientific Multiscan GO reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 450 nm, with 570 nm as a reference. The minimum detectable level of sOX40 and sOX40L was determined by the cut-off value of the standard curve. The lowest detectable levels of sOX40 and sOX40L were 1.9 and 0.039 ng/ml, respectively.\nFlow cytometry\nThe expression of OX40 and OX40L on the cell surface were analysed by flow cytometry on PBMCs from patients with AD and HC.\nThe cells were thawed and blocked with 100 \u03bcg/ml mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Europe Ltd, (JIR), Cambridgeshire, UK) to prevent unspecific binding.\nUnstimulated, blocked cells were stained using the following monoclonal antibodies, all titrated for optimal concentration: PE-Cy7-anti CD4 (cat. no. 560649, clone: RPA-T4), BV605-anti CD8 (cat. no. 564116, clone: SK1), BV510-anti CD14 (cat. no. 563079, clone: M\u03a6P9), PerCP-Cy5.5-anti CD45RO (cat. no. 560607, clone: UCHL1), FITC-anti CD56 (cat. no. 562794, clone: B159), BV 421-anti CLA (cat. no. 563961, clone: HECA-452) (all from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), APC-anti OX40 (cat. no. 17\u20131347, clone: ACT 35, eBioscience), PE-anti OX40L (cat. no.

After addition of antibodies the cells were incubated for 30 min in the dark at 4\u00b0C and washed 3 times in wash buffer (phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.09% sodium azide). Cells were fixed in 0.9% formaldehyde and analysed within 24 h on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer with Diva software (version: BDFacs Diva 8.0 (BD Biosciences)). Data were analysed on FlowJo Software for MAC version 10.1 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, USA). Fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls were used to gate OX40 and OX40L. Antibody-coated beads (OneComp, eBioscience) were used for compensation of spectral overlap.\nConfocal microscopy\nFormaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin biopsies from involved and uninvolved skin from 5 adult patients with AD and 5 HC were cut into 5-\u03bcm sections using a microtome (version: HM 360, MICROM, Microm UK LTD, Bicester, UK). Slides were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in an ethanol gradient, followed by heat-induced antigen retrieval in citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6).\nSlides were blocked with 10% donkey serum (cat. no.

In the group of adults with AD, the patients with asthma had significant higher sOX40 serum levels (10.0; range 4.0\u201312.8 pg/ml), compared with those without asthma (7.0; 4.6\u201310.2 pg/ml) (p < 0.01). In children, sOX40 correlated with SCORAD (\u03c1 = 0.404, p < 0.01) (Table II). Soluble OX40L showed no association with disease activity measurements, either in children or in adults.\nOX40 and OX40L are highly expressed by skin-homing T cells and monocytes in atopic dermatitis\nConsidering the reduced sOX40 serum levels in patients with AD, we investigated the surface expression of OX40 and its ligand on PBMCs from adult patients with AD. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs from adult patients with AD (n = 11) and HC (n = 10) revealed that OX40 was mainly expressed by skin-homing memory-prone CLA+ T cells, in both AD patients and HC (Fig. 2A and B).\nIn adult patients with AD, 8.9% (6.8\u201314.2%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells expressed OX40 followed by 4.6% (3.4\u20136.6%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells. OX40 expression in AD patients was less pronounced on CD8+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells (0.5%; 0.0\u20132.6%) and CD8+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells (0.7%; 0.4\u20131.3%)). No differences were observed compared with HC (Fig. 2A).\nA similar pattern emerged when the results were evaluated using median fluorescence intensity (MFI), although with important differences: CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells from patients with AD expressed the highest amount of OX40 per cell (MFI 287 (244\u2013317)), and revealed a significantly higher level than HC (MFI 235; range 215\u2013275) (p < 0.05). CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells expressed a lower amount of OX40 (MFI 246; range 238\u2013299), but also significantly higher than HC (MFI 214 (206\u2013231)) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern was observed for the CD8+ T cells, but to a lesser degree than by CD4+ T cells. In general, monocytes expressed high levels of OX40L both in percentage (64.1%; range 8.1\u201392.1%) and MFI (1964; range 244\u20133649) (Fig. 2C and D), but no differences were observed between AD and HC (all p > 0.05).\nCellular expression of OX40 in patients with atopic dermatitis inversely correlates with SCORAD\nTo further evaluate OX40 in AD, the relative cell populations were correlated with disease activity (SCORAD) and serum IgE. The percentage of CD4+CD45RO+OX40+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells correlated inversely with disease activity measured by SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.809, p < 0.01) and CLA\u2212 (\u03c1 = \u22120.782, p < 0.01)). Similarly, the MFI also correlated with SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.709, p < 0.1) and CLA- (\u03c1 = \u22120.674, p < 0.05)), but not with serum IgE levels. No correlations with disease activity and serum IgE for OX40 expressed by CD8+CD45RO+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells or OX40L expressed by monocytes were observed. Individual plasma levels of sOX40 and sOX40L did not correlate with surface expression of OX40 and OX40L (data not shown).\nOX40 and OX40L are co-localized in atopic dermatitis\nTo confirm the involvement of OX40-OX40L interactions directly in the skin, immunofluorescence staining was carried out on involved and uninvolved skin biopsies from adult patients with AD and from HC. OX40- and OX40L-expressing cells were identified in both involved and uninvolved tissue (not shown) and found to be co-localized within the dermis (Fig. 3A). In AD skin, in particular, OX40-positive staining was present on the surface of OX40L-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). That these were indeed OX40L-expressing mast cells were confirmed by positive tryptase staining (Fig. ",
		"Section Type: TITLE\nText: The OX40 Axis is Associated with Both Systemic and Local Involvement in Atopic Dermatitis\n\nSection Type: ABSTRACT\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis, and is dominated by Th2 cells. The co-stimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD, as their interactions are crucial for the generation of TH2 memory cells. Using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and flow cytometry on blood samples from patients with AD and healthy volunteers, this study shows that the serum level of soluble (s) OX40 is decreased in patients with AD, and the expression of OX40 by activated skin-homing CD4+ T cells is increased. This study further shows, using immunofluorescence on skin biopsies, that OX40+ and OX40L+ cells are co-located within the dermis, indicating local activity of OX40/OX40L. Serum levels of sOX40 were associated with atopic diseases and, together, these results support that the OX40 system is important for chronic inflammation in AD skin.\n\nSection Type: INTRO\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 20% of children and may persist into adulthood. The symptoms are eczema, intense pruritus, and dry skin, caused by a profound skin inflammation and epidermal barrier dysfunction. Up to 80% of patients with AD have elevated levels of IgE. Furthermore, development of memory T cells is believed to be central for chronicity in AD.\nOX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are both members of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily and are important regulators of the immune response. The OX40 system is required for generating a long-term memory response and optimal T-cell activation. The OX40-OX40L axis is considered to be involved in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including allergic asthma.\nT-cell expression of OX40 and antigen-presenting cells (APC) expression of OX40L appear within 2\u20133 days after antigen-activation. The signal through OX40 enhances T-cell clonal expansion and, especially, survival of TH2 cells. Apart from APC, OX40L is also expressed by mast cells. Both OX40 and OX40L also exist in soluble forms. Soluble OX40 (sOX40) has an anti-inflammatory effect when binding to the membrane-bound form of OX40L. sOX40 is able to mimic regulatory T-cell function, inhibit mast cell degranulation and thereby reduce the inflammatory response.\nSIGNIFICANCE\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease dominated by Th2 cells. The costimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are crucial for the generation of Th2 memory cells, and may thus play a central role in the pathogenesis and chronicity of atopic dermatitis. This study shows that OX40 expression is increased on skin-homing T cells in patients with atopic dermatitis, and that OX40 and OX40L cells are colocalized in the skin. These findings indicate that the OX40 system could play a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction of atopic dermatitis in the skin.\nNot only are mast cells implicated in the immediate hypersensitivity reactions, but also in the production of TH2 driving cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-25, and hence central mediators of AD pathogenesis.\nFurthermore, IgE-activated mast cells have been shown to interact with T cells through expression of OX40L, suggesting a sophisticated interplay between these immune cells mediated by IgE and OX40L.\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the OX40/ OX40L axis in AD, including the OX40 expressing cells and the correlation between serum levels and disease-specific markers.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: MATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatient samples\nPatients with AD were diagnosed using the Hanifin & Rajka criteria. None of the patients were receiving systemic immune suppressive therapy at the time of sample collection. All patients were assessed by use of the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD) and measurement of total IgE serum level.\nSerum samples from 67 adults (age 30; range 24\u201342 years), and 60 children with AD (age 8; 3\u201314 years) were collected at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. Clinical parameters were acquired at the time of blood collection: SCORAD, total serum IgE and the presence of asthma and/or rhinitis (Table I). Serum samples were also obtained from 31 healthy controls (HC) (age 39; 28\u201351 years) matched for age and sex with the adult AD group. The controls had no history of AD or other systemic inflammatory diseases. All adult patients with AD and HC gave their written informed consent. The parents provided written consent on behalf of their children with AD. For ethical reasons serum samples from healthy children were not included.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were collected from 11 adult patients with AD (age 29; 21\u201343 years) and 10 age- and sex-matched HC (age 27; 24\u201333 years) with no atopic diseases or systemic inflammatory diseases (Table I). The PBMCs were isolated",

For ethical reasons serum samples from healthy children were not included.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were collected from 11 adult patients with AD (age 29; 21\u201343 years) and 10 age- and sex-matched HC (age 27; 24\u201333 years) with no atopic diseases or systemic inflammatory diseases (Table I). The PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare Europe, Br\u00f8ndby, Denmark) density gradient centrifugation and frozen at \u2212135\u00b0C until analysis.\nParaffin-embedded biopsies were collected from involved and uninvolved skin from 5 patients with AD and skin biopsies were collected from 5 HC. Written consent was obtained in accordance with the guidelines of the Danish National Ethics Committee for Health Research and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\nDetection of sOX40 and sOX40L by ELISA\nSoluble OX40 and sOX40L were measured in serum from patients with AD and from HC with a sOX40 ELISA kit (cat. no. BMS296TEN, eBioscience (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA)) and with an inhouse sOX40L ELISA, as described previously. OD values were read by a Thermo Scientific Multiscan GO reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 450 nm, with 570 nm as a reference. The minimum detectable level of sOX40 and sOX40L was determined by the cut-off value of the standard curve. The lowest detectable levels of sOX40 and sOX40L were 1.9 and 0.039 ng/ml, respectively.\nFlow cytometry\nThe expression of OX40 and OX40L on the cell surface were analysed by flow cytometry on PBMCs from patients with AD and HC.\nThe cells were thawed and blocked with 100 \u03bcg/ml mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Europe Ltd, (JIR), Cambridgeshire, UK) to prevent unspecific binding.\nUnstimulated, blocked cells were stained using the following monoclonal antibodies, all titrated for optimal concentration: PE-Cy7-anti CD4 (cat. no. 560649, clone: RPA-T4), BV605-anti CD8 (cat. no. 564116, clone: SK1), BV510-anti CD14 (cat. no. 563079, clone: M\u03a6P9), PerCP-Cy5.5-anti CD45RO (cat. no. 560607, clone: UCHL1), FITC-anti CD56 (cat. no. 562794, clone: B159), BV 421-anti CLA (cat. no. 563961, clone: HECA-452) (all from BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), APC-anti OX40 (cat. no. 17\u20131347, clone: ACT 35, eBioscience), PE-anti OX40L (cat. no. FAB10541p, clone: 159403,R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and LIVE/DEAD Near IR antibody (cat. no. L10119, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for detection of dead cells. After addition of antibodies the cells were incubated for 30 min in the dark at 4\u00b0C and washed 3 times in wash buffer (phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.09% sodium azide). Cells were fixed in 0.9% formaldehyde and analysed within 24 h on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer with Diva software (version: BDFacs Diva 8.0 (BD Biosciences)). Data were analysed on FlowJo Software for MAC version 10.1 (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, USA). Fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls were used to gate OX40 and OX40L. Antibody-coated beads (OneComp, eBioscience) were used for compensation of spectral overlap.\nConfocal microscopy\nFormaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin biopsies from involved and uninvolved skin from 5 adult patients with AD and 5 HC were cut into 5-\u03bcm sections using a microtome (version: HM 360, MICROM, Microm UK LTD, Bicester, UK). Slides were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in an ethanol gradient, followed by heat-induced antigen retrieval in citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6).\nSlides were blocked with 10% donkey serum (cat. no.

Original magnification \u00d740.\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: DISCUSSION\nThe results of this study show that children and adults with AD have reduced serum levels of sOX40 compared with adult HC. Although the patients in the study cohort were included based on their presentation of AD, some patients also had allergic rhinitis and asthma. This subsequently made it possible to examine the association of serum levels of sOX40 and sOX40L and atopic comorbidities in patients with AD.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated elevated sOX40L levels in patients with active allergic asthma. This was further supported by Farres et al., who showed that increased expression of OX40L on B cells is associated with the level of total IgE in allergic asthma patients. These findings are in line with murine asthma models, in which OX40L is highly expressed by a variety of cells within the lung during an induced allergic reaction. Although, in general, decreased serum levels were observed in AD, adults with concomitant asthma had the highest levels of serum sOX40. As with all members of the TNF-super family, sOX40 can bind to its ligand expressed by different cell types. This may explain the decrease in serum levels of sOX40. However, in our experiments we observed similar levels of sOX40L in healthy volunteers and patients with AD and, thus, circulating sOX40L is not an appropriate marker of disease activity in AD.\nMore interestingly, focusing on circulating skin-homing CD4+ T cells from patients with AD we observed an increase in expression of OX40. As skin-homing T cells are able to upregulate OX40 expression, an increased number of pathogenic T cells can migrate to the inflammatory site of the skin and thereby enhance local inflammation.\nIn addition, this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness",

Original magnification \u00d740.\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: DISCUSSION\nThe results of this study show that children and adults with AD have reduced serum levels of sOX40 compared with adult HC. Although the patients in the study cohort were included based on their presentation of AD, some patients also had allergic rhinitis and asthma. This subsequently made it possible to examine the association of serum levels of sOX40 and sOX40L and atopic comorbidities in patients with AD.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated elevated sOX40L levels in patients with active allergic asthma. This was further supported by Farres et al., who showed that increased expression of OX40L on B cells is associated with the level of total IgE in allergic asthma patients. These findings are in line with murine asthma models, in which OX40L is highly expressed by a variety of cells within the lung during an induced allergic reaction. Although, in general, decreased serum levels were observed in AD, adults with concomitant asthma had the highest levels of serum sOX40. As with all members of the TNF-super family, sOX40 can bind to its ligand expressed by different cell types. This may explain the decrease in serum levels of sOX40. However, in our experiments we observed similar levels of sOX40L in healthy volunteers and patients with AD and, thus, circulating sOX40L is not an appropriate marker of disease activity in AD.\nMore interestingly, focusing on circulating skin-homing CD4+ T cells from patients with AD we observed an increase in expression of OX40. As skin-homing T cells are able to upregulate OX40 expression, an increased number of pathogenic T cells can migrate to the inflammatory site of the skin and thereby enhance local inflammation.\nIn addition, this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness",
		" pg/ml) compared with HC (15.6; 3.7\u201332.3 pg/ ml) (p < 0.0001). In children with AD, sOX40 levels were comparable with adult AD levels (9.7; 2.0\u201324.6 pg/ml) (Fig. 1A). Regarding sOX40L, no significant differences were observed between the groups (Fig. 1B).\nSerum levels of sOX40 is associated with atopic comorbidities and in children with disease activity\nSignificantly different levels of serum sOX40 were observed between the groups; therefore we examined the association between the individual serum sOX40 level, the SCORAD index, and other markers related to atopic disease activity. In the group of adults with AD, the patients with asthma had significant higher sOX40 serum levels (10.0; range 4.0\u201312.8 pg/ml), compared with those without asthma (7.0; 4.6\u201310.2 pg/ml) (p < 0.01). In children, sOX40 correlated with SCORAD (\u03c1 = 0.404, p < 0.01) (Table II). Soluble OX40L showed no association with disease activity measurements, either in children or in adults.\nOX40 and OX40L are highly expressed by skin-homing T cells and monocytes in atopic dermatitis\nConsidering the reduced sOX40 serum levels in patients with AD, we investigated the surface expression of OX40 and its ligand on PBMCs from adult patients with AD. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs from adult patients with AD (n = 11) and HC (n = 10) revealed that OX40 was mainly expressed by skin-homing memory-prone CLA+ T cells, in both AD patients and HC (Fig. 2A and B).\nIn adult patients with AD, 8.9% (6.8\u201314.2%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells expressed OX40 followed by 4.6% (3.4\u20136.6%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells. OX40 expression in AD patients was less pronounced on CD8+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells (0.5%; 0.0\u20132.6%) and CD8+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells (0.7%; 0.4\u20131.3%)). No differences were observed compared with HC (Fig. 2A).\nA similar pattern emerged when the results were evaluated using median fluorescence intensity (MFI), although with important differences: CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells from patients with AD expressed the highest amount of OX40 per cell (MFI 287 (244\u2013317)), and revealed a significantly higher level than HC (MFI 235; range 215\u2013275) (p < 0.05). CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells expressed a lower amount of OX40 (MFI 246; range 238\u2013299), but also significantly higher than HC (MFI 214 (206\u2013231)) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern was observed for the CD8+ T cells, but to a lesser degree than by CD4+ T cells. In general, monocytes expressed high levels of OX40L both in percentage (64.1%; range 8.1\u201392.1%) and MFI (1964; range 244\u20133649) (Fig. 2C and D), but no differences were observed between AD and HC (all p > 0.05).\nCellular expression of OX40 in patients with atopic dermatitis inversely correlates with SCORAD\nTo further evaluate OX40 in AD, the relative cell populations were correlated with disease activity (SCORAD) and serum IgE. The percentage of CD4+CD45RO+OX40+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells correlated inversely with disease activity measured by SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.809, p < 0.01) and CLA\u2212 (\u03c1 = \u22120.782, p < 0.01)). Similarly, the MFI also correlated with SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.709, p < 0.1) and CLA- (\u03c1 = \u22120.674, p < 0.05)), but not with serum IgE levels. No correlations with disease activity and serum IgE for OX40 expressed by CD8+CD45RO+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells or OX40L expressed by monocytes were observed.

		"Section Type: TITLE\nText: The OX40 Axis is Associated with Both Systemic and Local Involvement in Atopic Dermatitis\n\nSection Type: ABSTRACT\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis, and is dominated by Th2 cells. The co-stimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD, as their interactions are crucial for the generation of TH2 memory cells. Using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and flow cytometry on blood samples from patients with AD and healthy volunteers, this study shows that the serum level of soluble (s) OX40 is decreased in patients with AD, and the expression of OX40 by activated skin-homing CD4+ T cells is increased. This study further shows, using immunofluorescence on skin biopsies, that OX40+ and OX40L+ cells are co-located within the dermis, indicating local activity of OX40/OX40L. Serum levels of sOX40 were associated with atopic diseases and, together, these results support that the OX40 system is important for chronic inflammation in AD skin.\n\nSection Type: INTRO\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 20% of children and may persist into adulthood. The symptoms are eczema, intense pruritus, and dry skin, caused by a profound skin inflammation and epidermal barrier dysfunction. Up to 80% of patients with AD have elevated levels of IgE. Furthermore, development of memory T cells is believed to be central for chronicity in AD.\nOX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are both members of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily and are important regulators of the immune response. The OX40 system is required for generating a long-term memory response and optimal T-cell activation. The OX40-OX40L axis is considered to be involved in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including allergic asthma.\nT-cell expression of OX40 and antigen-presenting cells (APC) expression of OX40L appear within 2\u20133 days after antigen-activation. The signal through OX40 enhances T-cell clonal expansion and, especially, survival of TH2 cells. Apart from APC, OX40L is also expressed by mast cells. Both OX40 and OX40L also exist in soluble forms. Soluble OX40 (sOX40) has an anti-inflammatory effect when binding to the membrane-bound form of OX40L. sOX40 is able to mimic regulatory T-cell function, inhibit mast cell degranulation and thereby reduce the inflammatory response.\nSIGNIFICANCE\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease dominated by Th2 cells. The costimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are crucial for the generation of Th2 memory cells, and may thus play a central role in the pathogenesis and chronicity of atopic dermatitis. This study shows that OX40 expression is increased on skin-homing T cells in patients with atopic dermatitis, and that OX40 and OX40L cells are colocalized in the skin. These findings indicate that the OX40 system could play a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction of atopic dermatitis in the skin.\nNot only are mast cells implicated in the immediate hypersensitivity reactions, but also in the production of TH2 driving cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-25, and hence central mediators of AD pathogenesis.\nFurthermore, IgE-activated mast cells have been shown to interact with T cells through expression of OX40L, suggesting a sophisticated interplay between these immune cells mediated by IgE and OX40L.\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the OX40/ OX40L axis in AD, including the OX40 expressing cells and the correlation between serum levels and disease-specific markers.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: MATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatient samples\nPatients with AD were diagnosed using the Hanifin & Rajka criteria. None of the patients were receiving systemic immune suppressive therapy at the time of sample collection. All patients were assessed by use of the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD) and measurement of total IgE serum level.\nSerum samples from 67 adults (age 30; range 24\u201342 years), and 60 children with AD (age 8; 3\u201314 years) were collected at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. Clinical parameters were acquired at the time of blood collection: SCORAD, total serum IgE and the presence of asthma and/or rhinitis (Table I). Serum samples were also obtained from 31 healthy controls (HC) (age 39; 28\u201351 years) matched for age and sex with the adult AD group. The controls had no history of AD or other systemic inflammatory diseases. All adult patients with AD and HC gave their written informed consent. The parents provided written consent on behalf of their children with AD. For ethical reasons serum samples from healthy children were not included.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were collected from 11 adult patients with AD (age 29; 21\u201343 years) and 10 age- and sex-matched HC (age 27; 24\u201333 years) with no atopic diseases or systemic inflammatory diseases (Table I).

Regarding sOX40L, no significant differences were observed between the groups (Fig. 1B).\nSerum levels of sOX40 is associated with atopic comorbidities and in children with disease activity\nSignificantly different levels of serum sOX40 were observed between the groups; therefore we examined the association between the individual serum sOX40 level, the SCORAD index, and other markers related to atopic disease activity. In the group of adults with AD, the patients with asthma had significant higher sOX40 serum levels (10.0; range 4.0\u201312.8 pg/ml), compared with those without asthma (7.0; 4.6\u201310.2 pg/ml) (p < 0.01). In children, sOX40 correlated with SCORAD (\u03c1 = 0.404, p < 0.01) (Table II). Soluble OX40L showed no association with disease activity measurements, either in children or in adults.\nOX40 and OX40L are highly expressed by skin-homing T cells and monocytes in atopic dermatitis\nConsidering the reduced sOX40 serum levels in patients with AD, we investigated the surface expression of OX40 and its ligand on PBMCs from adult patients with AD. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs from adult patients with AD (n = 11) and HC (n = 10) revealed that OX40 was mainly expressed by skin-homing memory-prone CLA+ T cells, in both AD patients and HC (Fig. 2A and B).\nIn adult patients with AD, 8.9% (6.8\u201314.2%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells expressed OX40 followed by 4.6% (3.4\u20136.6%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells. OX40 expression in AD patients was less pronounced on CD8+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells (0.5%; 0.0\u20132.6%) and CD8+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells (0.7%; 0.4\u20131.3%)). No differences were observed compared with HC (Fig. 2A).\nA similar pattern emerged when the results were evaluated using median fluorescence intensity (MFI), although with important differences: CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells from patients with AD expressed the highest amount of OX40 per cell (MFI 287 (244\u2013317)), and revealed a significantly higher level than HC (MFI 235; range 215\u2013275) (p < 0.05). CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells expressed a lower amount of OX40 (MFI 246; range 238\u2013299), but also significantly higher than HC (MFI 214 (206\u2013231)) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern was observed for the CD8+ T cells, but to a lesser degree than by CD4+ T cells. In general, monocytes expressed high levels of OX40L both in percentage (64.1%; range 8.1\u201392.1%) and MFI (1964; range 244\u20133649) (Fig. 2C and D), but no differences were observed between AD and HC (all p > 0.05).\nCellular expression of OX40 in patients with atopic dermatitis inversely correlates with SCORAD\nTo further evaluate OX40 in AD, the relative cell populations were correlated with disease activity (SCORAD) and serum IgE. The percentage of CD4+CD45RO+OX40+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells correlated inversely with disease activity measured by SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.809, p < 0.01) and CLA\u2212 (\u03c1 = \u22120.782, p < 0.01)). Similarly, the MFI also correlated with SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.709, p < 0.1) and CLA- (\u03c1 = \u22120.674, p < 0.05)), but not with serum IgE levels. No correlations with disease activity and serum IgE for OX40 expressed by CD8+CD45RO+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells or OX40L expressed by monocytes were observed.

Although the patients in the study cohort were included based on their presentation of AD, some patients also had allergic rhinitis and asthma. This subsequently made it possible to examine the association of serum levels of sOX40 and sOX40L and atopic comorbidities in patients with AD.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated elevated sOX40L levels in patients with active allergic asthma. This was further supported by Farres et al., who showed that increased expression of OX40L on B cells is associated with the level of total IgE in allergic asthma patients. These findings are in line with murine asthma models, in which OX40L is highly expressed by a variety of cells within the lung during an induced allergic reaction. Although, in general, decreased serum levels were observed in AD, adults with concomitant asthma had the highest levels of serum sOX40. As with all members of the TNF-super family, sOX40 can bind to its ligand expressed by different cell types. This may explain the decrease in serum levels of sOX40. However, in our experiments we observed similar levels of sOX40L in healthy volunteers and patients with AD and, thus, circulating sOX40L is not an appropriate marker of disease activity in AD.\nMore interestingly, focusing on circulating skin-homing CD4+ T cells from patients with AD we observed an increase in expression of OX40. As skin-homing T cells are able to upregulate OX40 expression, an increased number of pathogenic T cells can migrate to the inflammatory site of the skin and thereby enhance local inflammation.\nIn addition, this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness",

Regarding sOX40L, no significant differences were observed between the groups (Fig. 1B).\nSerum levels of sOX40 is associated with atopic comorbidities and in children with disease activity\nSignificantly different levels of serum sOX40 were observed between the groups; therefore we examined the association between the individual serum sOX40 level, the SCORAD index, and other markers related to atopic disease activity. In the group of adults with AD, the patients with asthma had significant higher sOX40 serum levels (10.0; range 4.0\u201312.8 pg/ml), compared with those without asthma (7.0; 4.6\u201310.2 pg/ml) (p < 0.01). In children, sOX40 correlated with SCORAD (\u03c1 = 0.404, p < 0.01) (Table II). Soluble OX40L showed no association with disease activity measurements, either in children or in adults.\nOX40 and OX40L are highly expressed by skin-homing T cells and monocytes in atopic dermatitis\nConsidering the reduced sOX40 serum levels in patients with AD, we investigated the surface expression of OX40 and its ligand on PBMCs from adult patients with AD. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs from adult patients with AD (n = 11) and HC (n = 10) revealed that OX40 was mainly expressed by skin-homing memory-prone CLA+ T cells, in both AD patients and HC (Fig. 2A and B).\nIn adult patients with AD, 8.9% (6.8\u201314.2%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells expressed OX40 followed by 4.6% (3.4\u20136.6%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells. OX40 expression in AD patients was less pronounced on CD8+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells (0.5%; 0.0\u20132.6%) and CD8+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells (0.7%; 0.4\u20131.3%)). No differences were observed compared with HC (Fig. 2A).\nA similar pattern emerged when the results were evaluated using median fluorescence intensity (MFI), although with important differences: CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells from patients with AD expressed the highest amount of OX40 per cell (MFI 287 (244\u2013317)), and revealed a significantly higher level than HC (MFI 235; range 215\u2013275) (p < 0.05). CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells expressed a lower amount of OX40 (MFI 246; range 238\u2013299), but also significantly higher than HC (MFI 214 (206\u2013231)) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern was observed for the CD8+ T cells, but to a lesser degree than by CD4+ T cells. In general, monocytes expressed high levels of OX40L both in percentage (64.1%; range 8.1\u201392.1%) and MFI (1964; range 244\u20133649) (Fig. 2C and D), but no differences were observed between AD and HC (all p > 0.05).\nCellular expression of OX40 in patients with atopic dermatitis inversely correlates with SCORAD\nTo further evaluate OX40 in AD, the relative cell populations were correlated with disease activity (SCORAD) and serum IgE. The percentage of CD4+CD45RO+OX40+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells correlated inversely with disease activity measured by SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.809, p < 0.01) and CLA\u2212 (\u03c1 = \u22120.782, p < 0.01)). Similarly, the MFI also correlated with SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.709, p < 0.1) and CLA- (\u03c1 = \u22120.674, p < 0.05)), but not with serum IgE levels. No correlations with disease activity and serum IgE for OX40 expressed by CD8+CD45RO+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells or OX40L expressed by monocytes were observed. Individual plasma levels of sOX40 and sOX40L did not correlate with surface expression of OX40 and OX40L (data not shown).\nOX40 and OX40L are co-localized in atopic dermatitis\nTo confirm the involvement of OX40-OX40L interactions directly in the skin, immunofluorescence staining was carried out on involved and uninvolved skin biopsies from adult patients with AD and from HC. OX40- and OX40L-expressing cells were identified in both involved and uninvolved tissue (not shown) and found to be co-localized within the dermis (Fig. 3A). In AD skin, in particular, OX40-positive staining was present on the surface of OX40L-expressing cells (Fig. 3A).

Original magnification \u00d740.\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: DISCUSSION\nThe results of this study show that children and adults with AD have reduced serum levels of sOX40 compared with adult HC. Although the patients in the study cohort were included based on their presentation of AD, some patients also had allergic rhinitis and asthma. This subsequently made it possible to examine the association of serum levels of sOX40 and sOX40L and atopic comorbidities in patients with AD.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated elevated sOX40L levels in patients with active allergic asthma. This was further supported by Farres et al., who showed that increased expression of OX40L on B cells is associated with the level of total IgE in allergic asthma patients. These findings are in line with murine asthma models, in which OX40L is highly expressed by a variety of cells within the lung during an induced allergic reaction. Although, in general, decreased serum levels were observed in AD, adults with concomitant asthma had the highest levels of serum sOX40. As with all members of the TNF-super family, sOX40 can bind to its ligand expressed by different cell types. This may explain the decrease in serum levels of sOX40. However, in our experiments we observed similar levels of sOX40L in healthy volunteers and patients with AD and, thus, circulating sOX40L is not an appropriate marker of disease activity in AD.\nMore interestingly, focusing on circulating skin-homing CD4+ T cells from patients with AD we observed an increase in expression of OX40. As skin-homing T cells are able to upregulate OX40 expression, an increased number of pathogenic T cells can migrate to the inflammatory site of the skin and thereby enhance local inflammation.\nIn addition, this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness",

This finding is supported by the association of disease activity and atopic co-morbidities in atopic dermatitis, and we hypothesize that the OX40 system plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction in the skin. It is therefore of interest to follow the development of AD treatments targeting the OX40 system.\n The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. \n\nSection Type: REF\nText: REFERENCES\nAtopic dermatitis\nNew insights into atopic dermatitis\nThe role of TNF superfamily members in T-cell function and diseases\nOX40 promotes Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression and is essential for long-term survival of CD4 T cells\nThe OX40 costimulatory receptor determines the development of CD4 memory by regulating primary clonal expansion\nOX40-OX40 ligand interaction in T-cell-mediated immunity and immunopathology\nSoluble OX40L is associated with presence of autoantibodies in early rheumatoid arthritis\nSOX40L: an important inflammatory mediator in adult bronchial asthma\nInterruption of the OX40-OX40 ligand pathway in LDL receptor-deficient mice causes regression of atherosclerosis\nControl of immunity by the TNFR-related molecule OX40 (CD134)\nCritical role for OX40 ligand in the development of pathogenic Th2 cells in a murine model of asthma\nT cell proliferation by direct cross-talk between OX40 ligand on human mast cells and OX40 on human T cells: comparison of gene expression profiles between human tonsillar and lung-cultured mast cells\nTechnical advance: soluble OX40 molecule mimics regulatory T cell modulatory activity on FcepsilonRI-dependent mast cell degranulation\nMast cells produce interleukin-25 upon Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation\nMast cells enhance T cell activation: importance of mast cell costimulatory molecules and secreted TNF\nDiagnostic features of atopic dermatitis\nA simple set of validation steps identifies and removes false results in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay caused by anti-animal IgG antibodies in plasma from arthritis patients\nSerum OX40 ligand levels in asthmatic children: a potential biomarker of severity and persistence\nOX40 ligand: a potential costimulatory molecule in atopic asthma\nThe upregulated expression of OX40/OX40L and their promotion of T cells proliferation in the murine model of asthma\nCrucial role of OX40/OX40L signaling in a murine model of asthma\nGBR 830, an anti-OX40, improves skin gene signatures and clinical scores in patients with atopic dermatitis\n"

A dot plot showing the top 3 markers for each cluster marked the defining genes for each cluster, although with some overlap between clusters (B). Transcriptomic cytokine responses from several proinflammatory cytokines were used to interrogate each keratinocyte for each particular inflammatory signature, with cluster 7 showing overall the highest and broadest inflammatory signal, but with different specific inflammatory responses having different cluster localization in HS keratinocytes (n = 9) (see Methods) (C).\nIFN-\u03b3 and IL-36 responses are the most prominent keratinocyte immune responses in HS skin.\nSpecific cytokine responses were superimposed on the keratinocyte UMAP clusters to determine the distribution of key cytokine responses across different clusters (A).

These associations were similar when comparing lSSc and dSSc with controls. We also identified particular SNPs in the TNFSF4 gene region that are associated with the SSc-associated autoantibody subsets of SSc. Lastly, the exploratory method of analysis, CART, demonstrated a potential interaction between the TNFSF4 SNPs rs2205960 and rs855648 among Caucasian women patients with SSc that was confirmed by logistic regression analysis.\nTNFSF4 encodes for the protein OX40 ligand (OX40L). OX40L is expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells as well as non-immune cells such as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. It is the ligand for the OX40 which is expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, where it provides a costimulatory signal resulting in T cell proliferation, survival and cytokine production. Several studies have suggested that OX40\u2013OX40L interaction may preferentially promote T helper (Th)2 cytokines and may be a negative regulatory signal for interleukin (IL)17 production. More recently it has been suggested that OX40\u2013OX40L interactions inhibit the formation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. In addition to T cell effects, OX40\u2013OX40L interactions also have been reported to be critical in differentiation of B cells and antibody production. Lastly, it has been reported that plasmacytoid dendritic cells may regulate T helper responses through a balance of OX40L expression and type I interferon expression such that OX40L alone induces a Th2 response and OX40L with type I interferon may have a Th1 inducing effect. Together these studies suggest an important role for OX40\u2013OX40L interactions in critical immunoregulatory checkpoints that are likely involved in the development of autoimmunity. Accordingly, OX40L transgenic mice on the C57/BL6 background develop organ specific inflammation and targeted strategies to block OX40\u2013OX40L interactions have prevented the development of diabetes in the non-obese diabetic mouse and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis. It is likely that these pathways and OX40L-dependent immune alterations are important in the development of SSc. Indeed serum levels of OX40 have been reported to be elevated in patients with SSc, suggesting that the OX40\u2013OX40L pathway may be involved in SSc. However, specifically how the OX40L polymorphisms lead to the development of SSc is unknown.\nThe current report adds TNFSF4 to the list of genes that are associated with SSc susceptibility which includes major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, PTPN22, AIF1, IRF5, STAT4 and FAS. Furthermore, given the association of TNFSF4 with SLE as well as SSc, it is likely that TNFSF4 is a gene that confers risk to multiple autoimmune diseases. Why individual patients will develop a specific autoimmune disease such as SLE, RA, or SSc remains unknown. Functional studies of the polymorphisms in these genes as well as studies of gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interactions are necessary to better understand how the genetic associations lead to specific autoimmune diseases.\nOur study, despite its large size, is limited to the North American Caucasian population. Current efforts are underway to confirm these findings in other populations. However, we believe that the prior association of TNFSF4 with SLE and the emerging concepts of shared autoimmune genes provide some validation of our novel findings in SSc. Furthermore, the odds ratios that we observed in",
		"8B). Activation of these signaling pathways was validated by IHC for phospho-BTK and phospho-SYK (Figure 8C). Network analysis showed prominent clustering of increased HS DEGs around BTK and SYK nodes (Figure 9A). To determine therapeutic potential of these targets in HS, we used IgG/IgM-stimulated B cells, treated with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib, or the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib, and determined transcriptomic overlap and responses against DEGs in HS skin. The monocyte chemokine CCL4 was one of the most highly expressed chemokines in HS skin, with its mRNA expression increased by 7.7-fold (FDR = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u20133). Its expression was suppressed 19-fold by acalabrutinib, adjusted P = 5.6 \u00d7 10\u20135, and 22.8-fold by ibrutinib, adjusted P = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u20133 (Supplemental Table 6). Less pronounced overlap was seen for the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (Figure 9B).\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: Discussion\nThe etiology of HS is still incompletely understood but appears to be complex, with multiple factors contributing to its pathogenesis, including obesity, sex, hormonal factors, dysregulated microbiota, and genetics. In contrast to many other chronic inflammatory diseases, no genome-wide association studies have been performed in HS. However, studies on autosomal dominant forms of HS have identified mutations in genes belonging to the gamma-secretase complex, involved in regulation of Notch signaling activity, although in sporadic HS, these mutations seem to represent only a small minority of HS cases. One of the hallmark features of HS is the presence of deeply invasive epithelial tendrils that form tracts and keratin-filled cysts. Notably, in mouse skin, in the absence of gamma-secretase function, there is conversion of hair follicles to epidermal cysts with irregular ingrowths, suggesting that abnormal activity of gamma-secretases, and Notch signaling, may drive this feature of HS, although in this model no inflammation was noted. Whether the inflammatory response in HS is driving the ingrowth of epithelial tendrils or, conversely, tendril growth followed by rupture and release of keratinized and bacterial contents from the cysts and tracts is responsible for the inflammation is still unknown. While none of the NOTCH, NOTCH ligands, or gamma-secretase genes (NCSTN, PSENEN, and PSEN1) were differentially expressed in our data set, it is possible that our data did not capture changes in gamma-secretase or Notch signaling, as our study was focused on patients with chronic, established inflammatory disease. However, the early sequence of events in HS will need to be addressed in future studies.\nSeveral studies have implicated complement activation in the pathogenesis of HS. This includes studies showing elevated C5a, which is a breakdown product of complement pathway activation and a major neutrophil chemoattractant, in both blood and skin of HS patients. Neutrophils are prominent in HS, and a recent study demonstrated increased levels of neutrophils undergoing NETosis in both blood and skin of HS patients, with the amount of NETs disgorged in HS skin correlating with disease severity. Furthermore, this same study identified increased levels of autoantibodies recognizing citrullinated peptides and NET antigens. A recently published clinical trial using an IgG5 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to C5a and blocks its biological activity demonstrated modest clinical efficacy in HS.\nTranscriptomic profiling of HS skin has been performed by several groups, although these studies have been limited to relatively low-resolution microarray-based studies. These studies have shown increased number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells secreting IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 and increased mRNA expression of IL17A and IFNG in HS skin, accompanied by increased IL-17A CD4+ T cells in HS blood, but unchanged frequency of IFN-\u03b3\u2013secreting cells. These studies have suggested IL-17\u2013centric pathogenesis, supported by the role of IL-17A in psoriasis as one of the most highly enriched biological processes in HS skin, followed by interferon signaling, and are consistent with findings from our own group that showed increased protein levels of IL-17A and to a lesser extent IFN-\u03b3 in lesional HS skin. Furthermore, keratinocyte-derived IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 have been implicated in HS pathogenesis. Our data did not detect increased mRNA expression of IL1B in HS skin, and IL6 was decreased by about 4-fold (adjusted P = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u20133) (Supplemental Table 2). Instead, we found evidence for increased expression of IL36A and IL36G (Figure 1). In this context, case reports targeting the IL-1 axis in HS have provided mixed results, with some showing modest improvement and others showing no improvement. No clinical trial data exist on the use of anti\u2013IL-6 agents in HS, but one study noted development of HS in a patient undergoing the anti\u2013IL-6 treatment tocilizumab.\nOther inflammatory mediators implicated in HS include the type I IFNs, based primarily on the expression of IFN response genes, such as MX1, CXCL10, and IFI27. The expression of these was proposed to be driven by NETs interacting with infiltrating pDCs in lesional HS skin. In agreement with this study, we found evidence for both type I and type II IFN responses in our data set, most prominently in 4 of the",
		" infiltrates in HS, we used CyTOF imaging to identify and quantify infiltrating leukocytes. HS skin had a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration compared with normal skin (Figure 6A). When visualized using the dimensional reduction tool t-SNE, there was complete separation between the leukocyte clustering in HS skin compared with normal skin, with 12 distinct clusters being observed in HS and 2 clusters in normal (Figure 6B). Markers characterizing each cluster are shown (Figure 6, C and D), with plasma cells being the predominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS skin, followed by B cells, monocyte/macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils (Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that plasma cells and B cells constitute the dominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS. B cell and plasma cell subsets and associated gene transcripts are shown in Supplemental Figure 6.\nHS skin shows increased immunoglobulin production and diversity accompanied by complement activation.\nTo characterize the HS immune repertoire, B cell receptor (BCR) and TCR gene segments and complementarity determining region 3\u2013encoding (CDR3-encoding) sequences were mined from RNA-Seq data sets obtained from skin and blood of HS patients and healthy controls. This analysis revealed that based upon BCR CDR3 sequences and BCR gene segment abundances, there was a significant increase in the frequency of B cells in HS skin (P = 7.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 6.7 \u00d7 10\u20135, 9.8 \u00d7 10\u20135 and P = 8.3 \u00d7 10\u20135, 7.9 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20134 for BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clones per million and BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb gene segment reads per million, respectively) (Figure 7A). Next, to evaluate if there were any qualitative changes in the repertoire, BCR CDR3 alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the Shannon index (Figure 7A). This analysis revealed that the HS BCR repertoire was significantly more diverse than that of control skin (P = 5.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.6 \u00d7 10\u20134, and 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20136 BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clone Shannon diversity, respectively). To further evaluate whether the cutaneous B cell repertoire was qualitatively altered in the setting of HS, Jaccard distances were calculated as a measure of dissimilarity. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots of the beta diversity measures indicated good segregation of samples by disease status for BCR \u03ba and \u03bb light chain (Figure 7B). There was no separation by disease status when this analysis was performed for IgH CDR3 sequences. Thus, at least at the level of the BCR light chain gene rearrangements, there were clear qualitative and quantitative differences in the B cell repertoire of patients with HS. To explore this finding further at the level of individual B cell clones, heatmaps were constructed from data on clone frequencies across HS and healthy control skin. Similar to the PCoA plots, the frequencies of clonal abundance at the level of BCR \u03ba and \u03bb CDR3s across subjects was different enough to separate HS from healthy controls (Figure 7C). To assess deposition of IgGs and complement activation in HS, we stained for components and breakdown products of the complement pathway. This showed prominent protein expression of C1q, C3b, and C4d in HS skin, particularly in the deeper layers of the skin (Figure 7D). Complement receptors CR1 and CR2 were also increased in HS skin, along with IgG immune complex deposition (Figure 7E). To determine if this contributed to the proinflammatory environment in HS, we costained for TNF, the best characterized inflammatory mediator in HS, against B cells (CD20) and plasma cells (CD138). This showed nearly exclusive colocalization of TNF to plasma cells (Figure 7F). Less pronounced shifts in the mRNA expression of TCRs (TRA, TRB, TRD, TRG) was seen, in terms of both total reads and diversity (Supplemental Figure 3).\nBCR and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase signaling are potential therapeutic targets in HS.\nTo validate our transcriptomic findings, we performed IHC of excisional HS tissue of longstanding duration and with prominent sinus formation. This showed positive staining for CD3+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD138+ plasma cells mostly concentrated in the deeper aspect of the biopsy, around a sinus tract (Figure 8A). Analysis of the signal transduction network using literature-based networks (GePS) demonstrated enrichment for BCR signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201325), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201322), and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201313), with enriched signals for IL-17A (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), granzyme B (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), and CCR5 (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20134) (Figure 8B). Activation of these signaling pathways was validated by IHC for phospho-BTK and phospho-SYK (Figure 8C). Network analysis showed prominent clustering of increased HS DEGs around BTK and SYK nodes (Figure 9A). To determine therapeutic potential of these targets in HS, we used IgG/IgM-stimulated B cells, treated with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib, or the SYK inhibitor",

The expression of these was proposed to be driven by NETs interacting with infiltrating pDCs in lesional HS skin. In agreement with this study, we found evidence for both type I and type II IFN responses in our data set, most prominently in 4 of the scRNA-Seq keratinocyte clusters, which notably did not overlap with other clusters having pronounced IL-17 and TNF responses (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Of note, we were unable to detect pDCs in the scRNA-Seq data, and there was no increase in the mRNA expression of any of the type I IFN genes or the pDC markers CD123 or CD303. In contrast, mRNA expression of IFNG was increased by about 2.6-fold, and CXCL10 increased by about 2.7-fold, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 might have a greater contribution to the IFN response in HS than the type I IFNs.\nOur data identified B cells, and in particular plasma cells, as a potential therapeutic target in HS. Strikingly, TNF expression, the target of the only approved biologic treatment in HS, was localized to CD138+ plasma cells (Figure 7G). Successful use of B cell targeting in HS has been reported with the anti-CD20 agent rituximab in a patient undergoing treatment for an unrelated immune disorder. An ex vivo explant study of 10 patients in which skin explants were treated with rituximab demonstrated significant decrease in secretion of several proinflammatory mediators. However, anti-CD20 treatment would be unlikely to target plasma cells, as CD20 is downregulated in plasma cells with CD20 detected only on a small minority of plasma cells. An alternative approach to target plasma cells is to block active signaling pathways in these cells. The most enriched pathways in HS involved B cell signaling, including BCR signaling, SYK, LCK, and BTK (Figure 8A), and these pathways correlated with B cell (CD3) and plasma cell (CD138) infiltration in HS skin but not T cell (CD3) (Figure 8B). Notably, drugs targeting BTK have been shown to prevent plasma cell generation, and SYK has been shown to play a critical role for B cell antibody responses, memory B cell survival, and plasma cell expansion. While our therapeutic data were limited to B cells, they showed decreased B cell expression of several proinflammatory mediators that overlapped with HS skin, including CCL4, and this was more pronounced with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib than the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (Figure 9B). Consistent with an active role of B cells in HS pathogenesis is the observation that these cells are prominent in early HS lesions and are the major immune cell population attenuated with anti-TNF treatment.\nIn summary, while our data have some limitations, including analysis of mostly one ethnicity and lack of perilesional and matched unaffected skin from patients, we provide a comprehensive overview of the inflammatory pathogenesis of HS and help tie together previously discordant data. As there are no animal models of this disease, our data, through identification of potentially novel therapeutic signaling pathways, provide preclinical evidence that should accelerate the path toward clinical trials targeting either BTK or SYK in chronic, moderate-to-severe HS.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: Methods\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing.\nGeneration of single-cell suspensions for scRNA-Seq was performed as follows: lesional HS tissue was obtained from excisional samples from patients with severe HS. Samples were incubated overnight in 0.4% dispase (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Hank\u2019s Balanced Saline Solution (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4\u00b0C. Epidermis and dermis were separated. Epidermis was digested in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10 U/mL DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, quenched with FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), and strained through a 70 \u03bcM mesh. Dermis was minced, digested in 0.2% Collagenase II (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.2% Collagenase V (MilliporeSigma) in plain medium for 1.5 hours at 37\u00b0C, and strained through a 70 \u03bcM mesh. Epidermal and dermal cells were recombined, and libraries were constructed by the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core on the 10x Genomics Chromium system. Libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer to generate 151 bp paired-end reads. Data processing, including quality control, read alignment, and gene quantification, was conducted using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger software. Seurat was used for normalization, data integration, and clustering analysis. Clustered cells were mapped to corresponding cell types by matching cell cluster gene signatures with putative cell type\u2013specific markers.\nRNA-sequencing.\nSkin biopsies of 4 mm in diameter were taken, placed in tubes with RNAlater (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific), stored overnight at 4\u00b0C, and subsequently stored at \u201380\u00b0C until further processing. RNA isolation and sequencing were performed using the Illumina NextSeq platform and sequencing protocols as previously described.

A dot plot showing the top 3 markers for each cluster marked the defining genes for each cluster, although with some overlap between clusters (B).

Plasma cells were the predominant inflammatory infiltrate and most prominent in the deeper layers of the skin surrounding a deeper sinus tract (A), accompanied by increased expression of BTK, SYK, and LCK (B) (n = 3).

Network analysis showed prominent clustering of increased HS DEGs around BTK and SYK nodes (Figure 9A). To determine therapeutic potential of these targets in HS, we used IgG/IgM-stimulated B cells, treated with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib, or the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib, and determined transcriptomic overlap and responses against DEGs in HS skin. The monocyte chemokine CCL4 was one of the most highly expressed chemokines in HS skin, with its mRNA expression increased by 7.7-fold (FDR = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u20133). Its expression was suppressed 19-fold by acalabrutinib, adjusted P = 5.6 \u00d7 10\u20135, and 22.8-fold by ibrutinib, adjusted P = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u20133 (Supplemental Table 6). Less pronounced overlap was seen for the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (Figure 9B).\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: Discussion\nThe etiology of HS is still incompletely understood but appears to be complex, with multiple factors contributing to its pathogenesis, including obesity, sex, hormonal factors, dysregulated microbiota, and genetics. In contrast to many other chronic inflammatory diseases, no genome-wide association studies have been performed in HS. However, studies on autosomal dominant forms of HS have identified mutations in genes belonging to the gamma-secretase complex, involved in regulation of Notch signaling activity, although in sporadic HS, these mutations seem to represent only a small minority of HS cases. One of the hallmark features of HS is the presence of deeply invasive epithelial tendrils that form tracts and keratin-filled cysts. Notably, in mouse skin, in the absence of gamma-secretase function, there is conversion of hair follicles to epidermal cysts with irregular ingrowths, suggesting that abnormal activity of gamma-secretases, and Notch signaling, may drive this feature of HS, although in this model no inflammation was noted. Whether the inflammatory response in HS is driving the ingrowth of epithelial tendrils or, conversely, tendril growth followed by rupture and release of keratinized and bacterial contents from the cysts and tracts is responsible for the inflammation is still unknown. While none of the NOTCH, NOTCH ligands, or gamma-secretase genes (NCSTN, PSENEN, and PSEN1) were differentially expressed in our data set, it is possible that our data did not capture changes in gamma-secretase or Notch signaling, as our study was focused on patients with chronic, established inflammatory disease. However, the early sequence of events in HS will need to be addressed in future studies.\nSeveral studies have implicated complement activation in the pathogenesis of HS. This includes studies showing elevated C5a, which is a breakdown product of complement pathway activation and a major neutrophil chemoattractant, in both blood and skin of HS patients. Neutrophils are prominent in HS, and a recent study demonstrated increased levels of neutrophils undergoing NETosis in both blood and skin of HS patients, with the amount of NETs disgorged in HS skin correlating with disease severity. Furthermore, this same study identified increased levels of autoantibodies recognizing citrullinated peptides and NET antigens. A recently published clinical trial using an IgG5 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to C5a and blocks its biological activity demonstrated modest clinical efficacy in HS.\nTranscriptomic profiling of HS skin has been performed by several groups, although these studies have been limited to relatively low-resolution microarray-based studies. These studies have shown increased number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells secreting IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 and increased mRNA expression of IL17A and IFNG in HS skin, accompanied by increased IL-17A CD4+ T cells in HS blood, but unchanged frequency of IFN-\u03b3\u2013secreting cells. These studies have suggested IL-17\u2013centric pathogenesis, supported by the role of IL-17A in psoriasis as one of the most highly enriched biological processes in HS skin, followed by interferon signaling, and are consistent with findings from our own group that showed increased protein levels of IL-17A and to a lesser extent IFN-\u03b3 in lesional HS skin. Furthermore, keratinocyte-derived IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 have been implicated in HS pathogenesis. Our data did not detect increased mRNA expression of IL1B in HS skin, and IL6 was decreased by about 4-fold (adjusted P = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u20133) (Supplemental Table 2). Instead, we found evidence for increased expression of IL36A and IL36G (Figure 1). In this context, case reports targeting the IL-1 axis in HS have provided mixed results, with some showing modest improvement and others showing no improvement. No clinical trial data exist on the use of anti\u2013IL-6 agents in HS, but one study noted development of HS in a patient undergoing the anti\u2013IL-6 treatment tocilizumab.\nOther inflammatory mediators implicated in HS include the type I IFNs, based primarily on the expression of IFN response genes, such as MX1, CXCL10, and IFI27. The expression of these was proposed to be driven by NETs interacting with infiltrating pDCs in lesional HS skin. In agreement with this study, we found evidence for both type I and type II IFN responses in our data set, most prominently in 4 of the",
		" infiltrates in HS, we used CyTOF imaging to identify and quantify infiltrating leukocytes. HS skin had a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration compared with normal skin (Figure 6A). When visualized using the dimensional reduction tool t-SNE, there was complete separation between the leukocyte clustering in HS skin compared with normal skin, with 12 distinct clusters being observed in HS and 2 clusters in normal (Figure 6B). Markers characterizing each cluster are shown (Figure 6, C and D), with plasma cells being the predominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS skin, followed by B cells, monocyte/macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils (Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that plasma cells and B cells constitute the dominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS. B cell and plasma cell subsets and associated gene transcripts are shown in Supplemental Figure 6.\nHS skin shows increased immunoglobulin production and diversity accompanied by complement activation.\nTo characterize the HS immune repertoire, B cell receptor (BCR) and TCR gene segments and complementarity determining region 3\u2013encoding (CDR3-encoding) sequences were mined from RNA-Seq data sets obtained from skin and blood of HS patients and healthy controls. This analysis revealed that based upon BCR CDR3 sequences and BCR gene segment abundances, there was a significant increase in the frequency of B cells in HS skin (P = 7.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 6.7 \u00d7 10\u20135, 9.8 \u00d7 10\u20135 and P = 8.3 \u00d7 10\u20135, 7.9 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20134 for BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clones per million and BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb gene segment reads per million, respectively) (Figure 7A). Next, to evaluate if there were any qualitative changes in the repertoire, BCR CDR3 alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the Shannon index (Figure 7A). This analysis revealed that the HS BCR repertoire was significantly more diverse than that of control skin (P = 5.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.6 \u00d7 10\u20134, and 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20136 BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clone Shannon diversity, respectively). To further evaluate whether the cutaneous B cell repertoire was qualitatively altered in the setting of HS, Jaccard distances were calculated as a measure of dissimilarity. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots of the beta diversity measures indicated good segregation of samples by disease status for BCR \u03ba and \u03bb light chain (Figure 7B). There was no separation by disease status when this analysis was performed for IgH CDR3 sequences. Thus, at least at the level of the BCR light chain gene rearrangements, there were clear qualitative and quantitative differences in the B cell repertoire of patients with HS. To explore this finding further at the level of individual B cell clones, heatmaps were constructed from data on clone frequencies across HS and healthy control skin. Similar to the PCoA plots, the frequencies of clonal abundance at the level of BCR \u03ba and \u03bb CDR3s across subjects was different enough to separate HS from healthy controls (Figure 7C). To assess deposition of IgGs and complement activation in HS, we stained for components and breakdown products of the complement pathway. This showed prominent protein expression of C1q, C3b, and C4d in HS skin, particularly in the deeper layers of the skin (Figure 7D). Complement receptors CR1 and CR2 were also increased in HS skin, along with IgG immune complex deposition (Figure 7E). To determine if this contributed to the proinflammatory environment in HS, we costained for TNF, the best characterized inflammatory mediator in HS, against B cells (CD20) and plasma cells (CD138). This showed nearly exclusive colocalization of TNF to plasma cells (Figure 7F). Less pronounced shifts in the mRNA expression of TCRs (TRA, TRB, TRD, TRG) was seen, in terms of both total reads and diversity (Supplemental Figure 3).\nBCR and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase signaling are potential therapeutic targets in HS.\nTo validate our transcriptomic findings, we performed IHC of excisional HS tissue of longstanding duration and with prominent sinus formation. This showed positive staining for CD3+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD138+ plasma cells mostly concentrated in the deeper aspect of the biopsy, around a sinus tract (Figure 8A). Analysis of the signal transduction network using literature-based networks (GePS) demonstrated enrichment for BCR signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201325), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201322), and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201313), with enriched signals for IL-17A (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), granzyme B (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), and CCR5 (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20134) (Figure 8B). Activation of these signaling pathways was validated by IHC for phospho-BTK and phospho-SYK (Figure 8C). Network analysis showed prominent clustering of increased HS DEGs around BTK and SYK nodes (Figure 9A).

To determine therapeutic potential of these targets in HS, we used IgG/IgM-stimulated B cells, treated with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib, or the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib, and determined transcriptomic overlap and responses against DEGs in HS skin. The monocyte chemokine CCL4 was one of the most highly expressed chemokines in HS skin, with its mRNA expression increased by 7.7-fold (FDR = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u20133). Its expression was suppressed 19-fold by acalabrutinib, adjusted P = 5.6 \u00d7 10\u20135, and 22.8-fold by ibrutinib, adjusted P = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u20133 (Supplemental Table 6). Less pronounced overlap was seen for the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (Figure 9B).\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: Discussion\nThe etiology of HS is still incompletely understood but appears to be complex, with multiple factors contributing to its pathogenesis, including obesity, sex, hormonal factors, dysregulated microbiota, and genetics. In contrast to many other chronic inflammatory diseases, no genome-wide association studies have been performed in HS. However, studies on autosomal dominant forms of HS have identified mutations in genes belonging to the gamma-secretase complex, involved in regulation of Notch signaling activity, although in sporadic HS, these mutations seem to represent only a small minority of HS cases. One of the hallmark features of HS is the presence of deeply invasive epithelial tendrils that form tracts and keratin-filled cysts. Notably, in mouse skin, in the absence of gamma-secretase function, there is conversion of hair follicles to epidermal cysts with irregular ingrowths, suggesting that abnormal activity of gamma-secretases, and Notch signaling, may drive this feature of HS, although in this model no inflammation was noted. Whether the inflammatory response in HS is driving the ingrowth of epithelial tendrils or, conversely, tendril growth followed by rupture and release of keratinized and bacterial contents from the cysts and tracts is responsible for the inflammation is still unknown. While none of the NOTCH, NOTCH ligands, or gamma-secretase genes (NCSTN, PSENEN, and PSEN1) were differentially expressed in our data set, it is possible that our data did not capture changes in gamma-secretase or Notch signaling, as our study was focused on patients with chronic, established inflammatory disease. However, the early sequence of events in HS will need to be addressed in future studies.\nSeveral studies have implicated complement activation in the pathogenesis of HS. This includes studies showing elevated C5a, which is a breakdown product of complement pathway activation and a major neutrophil chemoattractant, in both blood and skin of HS patients. Neutrophils are prominent in HS, and a recent study demonstrated increased levels of neutrophils undergoing NETosis in both blood and skin of HS patients, with the amount of NETs disgorged in HS skin correlating with disease severity. Furthermore, this same study identified increased levels of autoantibodies recognizing citrullinated peptides and NET antigens. A recently published clinical trial using an IgG5 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to C5a and blocks its biological activity demonstrated modest clinical efficacy in HS.\nTranscriptomic profiling of HS skin has been performed by several groups, although these studies have been limited to relatively low-resolution microarray-based studies. These studies have shown increased number of infiltrating CD4+ T cells secreting IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3 and increased mRNA expression of IL17A and IFNG in HS skin, accompanied by increased IL-17A CD4+ T cells in HS blood, but unchanged frequency of IFN-\u03b3\u2013secreting cells. These studies have suggested IL-17\u2013centric pathogenesis, supported by the role of IL-17A in psoriasis as one of the most highly enriched biological processes in HS skin, followed by interferon signaling, and are consistent with findings from our own group that showed increased protein levels of IL-17A and to a lesser extent IFN-\u03b3 in lesional HS skin. Furthermore, keratinocyte-derived IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 have been implicated in HS pathogenesis. Our data did not detect increased mRNA expression of IL1B in HS skin, and IL6 was decreased by about 4-fold (adjusted P = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u20133) (Supplemental Table 2). Instead, we found evidence for increased expression of IL36A and IL36G (Figure 1). In this context, case reports targeting the IL-1 axis in HS have provided mixed results, with some showing modest improvement and others showing no improvement. No clinical trial data exist on the use of anti\u2013IL-6 agents in HS, but one study noted development of HS in a patient undergoing the anti\u2013IL-6 treatment tocilizumab.\nOther inflammatory mediators implicated in HS include the type I IFNs, based primarily on the expression of IFN response genes, such as MX1, CXCL10, and IFI27. The expression of these was proposed to be driven by NETs interacting with infiltrating pDCs in lesional HS skin. In agreement with this study, we found evidence for both type I and type II IFN responses in our data set, most prominently in 4 of the",
		" infiltrates in HS, we used CyTOF imaging to identify and quantify infiltrating leukocytes. HS skin had a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration compared with normal skin (Figure 6A). When visualized using the dimensional reduction tool t-SNE, there was complete separation between the leukocyte clustering in HS skin compared with normal skin, with 12 distinct clusters being observed in HS and 2 clusters in normal (Figure 6B). Markers characterizing each cluster are shown (Figure 6, C and D), with plasma cells being the predominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS skin, followed by B cells, monocyte/macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils (Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that plasma cells and B cells constitute the dominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS. B cell and plasma cell subsets and associated gene transcripts are shown in Supplemental Figure 6.\nHS skin shows increased immunoglobulin production and diversity accompanied by complement activation.\nTo characterize the HS immune repertoire, B cell receptor (BCR) and TCR gene segments and complementarity determining region 3\u2013encoding (CDR3-encoding) sequences were mined from RNA-Seq data sets obtained from skin and blood of HS patients and healthy controls. This analysis revealed that based upon BCR CDR3 sequences and BCR gene segment abundances, there was a significant increase in the frequency of B cells in HS skin (P = 7.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 6.7 \u00d7 10\u20135, 9.8 \u00d7 10\u20135 and P = 8.3 \u00d7 10\u20135, 7.9 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20134 for BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clones per million and BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb gene segment reads per million, respectively) (Figure 7A). Next, to evaluate if there were any qualitative changes in the repertoire, BCR CDR3 alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the Shannon index (Figure 7A). This analysis revealed that the HS BCR repertoire was significantly more diverse than that of control skin (P = 5.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.6 \u00d7 10\u20134, and 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20136 BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clone Shannon diversity, respectively). To further evaluate whether the cutaneous B cell repertoire was qualitatively altered in the setting of HS, Jaccard distances were calculated as a measure of dissimilarity. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots of the beta diversity measures indicated good segregation of samples by disease status for BCR \u03ba and \u03bb light chain (Figure 7B). There was no separation by disease status when this analysis was performed for IgH CDR3 sequences. Thus, at least at the level of the BCR light chain gene rearrangements, there were clear qualitative and quantitative differences in the B cell repertoire of patients with HS. To explore this finding further at the level of individual B cell clones, heatmaps were constructed from data on clone frequencies across HS and healthy control skin. Similar to the PCoA plots, the frequencies of clonal abundance at the level of BCR \u03ba and \u03bb CDR3s across subjects was different enough to separate HS from healthy controls (Figure 7C). To assess deposition of IgGs and complement activation in HS, we stained for components and breakdown products of the complement pathway. This showed prominent protein expression of C1q, C3b, and C4d in HS skin, particularly in the deeper layers of the skin (Figure 7D). Complement receptors CR1 and CR2 were also increased in HS skin, along with IgG immune complex deposition (Figure 7E). To determine if this contributed to the proinflammatory environment in HS, we costained for TNF, the best characterized inflammatory mediator in HS, against B cells (CD20) and plasma cells (CD138). This showed nearly exclusive colocalization of TNF to plasma cells (Figure 7F). Less pronounced shifts in the mRNA expression of TCRs (TRA, TRB, TRD, TRG) was seen, in terms of both total reads and diversity (Supplemental Figure 3).\nBCR and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase signaling are potential therapeutic targets in HS.\nTo validate our transcriptomic findings, we performed IHC of excisional HS tissue of longstanding duration and with prominent sinus formation. This showed positive staining for CD3+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD138+ plasma cells mostly concentrated in the deeper aspect of the biopsy, around a sinus tract (Figure 8A). Analysis of the signal transduction network using literature-based networks (GePS) demonstrated enrichment for BCR signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201325), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201322), and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201313), with enriched signals for IL-17A (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), granzyme B (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), and CCR5 (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20134) (Figure 8B). Activation of these signaling pathways was validated by IHC for phospho-BTK and phospho-SYK (Figure 8C). Network analysis showed prominent clustering of increased HS DEGs around BTK and SYK nodes (Figure 9A).

		" this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness when used as treatment for AD.\nTogether, these findings indicate a close correlation between the OX40 system and atopic diseases.\nIn conclusion, OX40 expression is increased on skinhoming T cells and, together with our finding that OX40 and OX40L are co-localized in the skin, the OX40-OX40L system may play an important role in the recruitment to and activation of these cells in the skin. This finding is supported by the association of disease activity and atopic co-morbidities in atopic dermatitis, and we hypothesize that the OX40 system plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction in the skin.

Components of the complement pathway (C1q) and breakdown products of activated complement components (C3b, C4d) were increased in HS skin, particularly in the deeper layers of the skin (n = 3) (scale bar: 100 \u03bcm) (D). Complement receptors, CR1 and CR2, were increased in the deeper layers of HS, along with IgG1 immune complex deposition (n = 3) (scale bar: 100 \u03bcm) (E).

To confirm the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate in HS and the localization of components of the enriched signaling pathways, we performed IHC in an excisional biopsy for CD3, CD20, and CD138. Plasma cells were the predominant inflammatory infiltrate and most prominent in the deeper layers of the skin surrounding a deeper sinus tract (A), accompanied by increased expression of BTK, SYK, and LCK (B) (n = 3). Activation of key components of this signaling pathway was confirmed by IHC for both phospho-BTK and phospho-SYK (n = 3) (C).\nB cell receptor signaling is central to HS transcriptomic changes and a potential therapeutic target in HS.\nOutline of the GePS network in HS skin centered on critical inflammatory nodes, including BTK, SYK, JUN, and STAT1 signaling (red/brown indicating increased expression and green indicating decreased expression) (A).

		"scRNA-Seq) was performed on cells isolated from 9 excisional samples from patients with severe HS. We collected 30,636 cells with a median 1974 genes and a median 7342 transcripts. We did unsupervised clustering analysis and grouped the cells into 22 clusters (Figure 2A), which were further annotated as 10 cell types including keratinocytes, melanocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, B cells, plasma cells, T cells, myeloid cells, and mast cells (Figure 2A). Three representative signature genes for each cell type are shown in the heatmap (Figure 2B). To learn cell-cell communication between the cell types, we performed CellPhoneDB ligand-receptor analysis and plotted the top ranked 200 pairs in a Circos plot (Figure 2C). We also show the connection linked from or to B cells and plasma cells (Figure 3, A and B). The ligand-receptor analysis demonstrated extensive interactions between all the major cell subsets in HS, including interactions of B cells and plasma cells with stromal tissue cells and other immune cell components. Notable interactions include members of the Notch signaling pathway with endothelial and keratinocyte cell populations, keratinocyte-derived CCL20 with T cells, and interaction of IFN-\u03b3 with various stromal cell clusters (Supplemental Table 4). We identified both IL17A- and IFNG-expressing T cells in HS skin (Supplemental Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure 5). Notably, IL18, a promoter of IFN-\u03b3 responses, was primarily derived from keratinocytes. We also performed enrichment analysis on the signature genes for each cell type, demonstrating enrichment of complement activation (P = 5.0 \u00d7 10\u201311), positive regulation of B cell activation (P = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u201310), and antibacterial humoral response (1.6 \u00d7 10\u20135) in the plasma cell population; B cell receptor signaling pathway (P = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u20138) and IFN-\u03b3 mediated signaling pathway (P = 0.03) in B cells; inflammatory response (P = 6.2 \u00d7 10\u201315) and neutrophil chemotaxis (P = 3.9 \u00d7 10\u20137) in the myeloid cell population; and T cell receptor signaling pathway (P = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u201314), T cell costimulation (P = 7.0 \u00d7 10\u201311), and regulation of TNF-mediated signaling (P = 8.4 \u00d7 10\u20136) in the T cell compartment (Figure 2D).\nKeratinocytes show heightened type II IFN and IL-36 responses.\nTo study the cytokine response in the largest population in our scRNA-Seq data, we performed subclustering on the keratinocytes and obtained 13 subclusters (Figure 4A). The top marker genes for each subcluster are shown in Figure 4B. We used a broad range of cytokine response signatures, as previously described by our group, to interrogate each keratinocyte subcluster for a particular inflammatory signature (Supplemental Table 5). A module score for each cytokine was calculated for each cell based on the expression of the signature genes induced by the cytokine. Then the module scores for each subcluster were plotted in Figure 4C. This demonstrates high inflammatory burden in keratinocytes in subcluster 7, particularly for IL-17 responses (adjusted P < 1 \u00d7 10\u2013250), IL-36 responses (adjusted P = 6.4 \u00d7 10\u201377), and TNF responses (adjusted P = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u20139). This cluster was characterized by high expression of antimicrobial genes, such as DEFB4A, S100A7A, and IL36G. In contrast, subclusters 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8 showed enrichment for both type I and type II IFN responses (adjusted P < 1 \u00d7 10\u2013250), with IFN-\u03b3 additionally showing an enriched response in subcluster 7 (adjusted P < 1 \u00d7 10\u2013250). The distribution of each cytokine response can also be observed by plotting the module scores on the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (Figure 5A). To address the specificity of each signal, we focused on the 4 main responses: IFN-\u03b3, TNF, IL-17A, and IL-36. Of these, unique cytokine responses were most abundant for IFN-\u03b3, followed by IL-36 and TNF (red lines) (Figure 5B), whereas nonspecific and overlapping responses were observed for IL-17A and to a lesser extent for the other cytokine responses (gray lines, Figure 5B). These data demonstrate that only a proportion of keratinocytes are responding to inflammatory stimuli in HS and that these responses are dominated by IFN-\u03b3, followed by IL-36G and TNF, with lesser contribution by IL-17A.\nB cells and plasma cells predominate in HS skin lesions.\nTo determine whether the transcriptomic signatures align with the cellular infiltrates in HS, we used CyTOF imaging to identify and quantify infiltrating leukocytes. HS skin had a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration compared with normal skin (Figure 6A). When visualized using the dimensional reduction tool t-SNE, there was complete separation between the leukocyte clustering in HS skin compared with normal skin, with 12 distinct clusters being observed in HS and 2 clusters in normal (Figure 6B). Markers characterizing each cluster are shown (Figure",
		"plemental Figure 1). The most upregulated genes in skin were associated with B cell responses, including immunoglobulin genes such as IGLV3-27 (100-fold increased, adjusted P = 2.74 \u00d7 10\u20135), CD19 (33-fold, adjusted P = 6.48 \u00d7 10\u201324), and CD79a (32-fold, adjusted P = 3.58 \u00d7 10\u201322). Other genes included the antimicrobial gene DEFB4A (24-fold, adjusted P = 2.71 \u00d7 10\u201310); CXCL13, a B cell chemoattractant (16-fold, adjusted P = 1.25 \u00d7 10\u20138); and the neutrophil chemokine CXCL1 (2.8-fold, adjusted P = 2.91 \u00d7 10\u20132). In the WB, there were 332 DEGs, of which 230 were increased and 102 decreased (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).\nHS shows a complex inflammatory profile distinct from that of psoriasis or atopic dermatitis and enriched in genes involved in B cell function.\nTo address the major transcriptomic characteristics of HS, we compared it with RNA-Seq data from psoriasis (n = 28) and atopic dermatitis (AD) (n = 32) because the inflammatory responses in these 2 diseases are well characterized, and many of the drugs currently approved for these diseases are currently being repurposed for treatment of HS. Interestingly, genes dysregulated in lesional skin for all 3 diseases included the antimicrobial genes DEFB4A, SPRR2F, CD177, and TCN1. In terms of expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes in HS, we observed increased mRNA expression of IFNG (2.6-fold, adjusted P = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u20132), IL17A (8.6-fold, adjusted P = 6.7 \u00d7 10\u20137), IL17F (13.3-fold, adjusted P = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u20139), IL36A (9-fold, adjusted P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u20134), and IL36G (2.4-fold, adjusted P = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u20132) compared with healthy controls, whereas IL13 and IL17C expression were overall decreased (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 2). Notably, the elevation of IL17A and IL17F expression in HS was comparable to the expression levels in psoriatic skin. With regard to the magnitude of the cytokine response in HS skin, we observed significant responses for stimulation of type II IFN (i.e., IFN-\u03b3; P = 5.9 \u00d7 10\u20135) and IL-36 (P = 9.3 \u00d7 10\u20134) in HS lesional skin, whereas the effect of Th2 response (i.e., IL-4), IL-17A, or TNF stimulation was absent in HS skin (Figure 1C). These data demonstrate lack of a dominant Th cytokine axis in HS, in contrast to AD (Th2) or psoriasis (Th17). To address the unique inflammatory responses in HS, we compared HS with either psoriasis or AD and found that the most prominent genes unique to HS included genes encoding immunoglobulins (Figure 1D). Using bulk RNA-Seq data from HS skin, we interrogated for cell type\u2013specific signatures. For HS skin the top 3 cell signatures were assigned to B cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201340), followed by various T cell populations, including Th2, and CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201312) (Figure 1E). In contrast, cell type signatures in blood included CD4+ naive cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201320), Th17 cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201315), and Th2 cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201312) (Figure 1E). Biological processes enriched among increased DEGs in HS skin included immune response (adjusted P = 7.64 \u00d7 10\u201384), regulation of immune response (adjusted P = 8.26 \u00d7 10\u201382), complement activation (adjusted P = 2.09 \u00d7 10\u201356), Fc-gamma receptor signaling pathway (FDR = 8.86 \u00d7 10\u201341), innate immune response (FDR = 4.92 \u00d7 10\u201333), B cell receptor signaling (FDR = 2.32 \u00d7 10\u201323), and neutrophil chemotaxis (FDR 8.75 \u00d7 10\u201311). Biological processes enriched among decreased DEGs included PPAR signaling pathway (adjusted P = 3.17 \u00d7 10\u20137) and steroid biosynthesis (adjusted P = 0.008). KEGG pathways among decreased DEGs included cholesterol biosynthetic process (adjusted P = 9.64 \u00d7 10\u201311) and lipid metabolic process (adjusted P = 5.5 \u00d7 10\u20134) (Figure 1F).\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing outlines the cellular composition of HS.\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) was performed on cells isolated from 9 excisional samples from patients with severe HS. We collected 30,636 cells with a median 1974 genes and a median 7342 transcripts.

Using proteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we characterized the inflammatory responses in HS in depth, revealing immune responses centered on IFN-\u03b3, IL-36, and TNF, with lesser contribution from IL-17A. We further identified B cells and plasma cells, with associated increases in immunoglobulin production and complement activation, as pivotal players in HS pathogenesis, with Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) pathway activation as a central signal transduction network in HS. These data provide preclinical evidence to accelerate the path toward clinical trials targeting BTK and SYK signaling in moderate-to-severe HS.\nB-cells and plasma cells are critical pathogenic cell populations in chronic Hidradenitis Suppurativa and are potential therapeutic targets.\n\nSection Type: INTRO\nText: Introduction\nHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a debilitating chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by chronic abscess formation and development of multiple draining sinus tracts in the groin, axillae, and perineum. It has an estimated prevalence of approximately 1% and is more common in women and specific ethnic groups, such as African Americans, in which the incidence may be up to 3-fold higher than in Caucasians. It frequently arises during adolescence and is a lifelong disease with a marked negative effect on quality of life. It is associated with several comorbidities, including obesity, and has a prominent hormonal component. Several genetic mutations involving 3 gamma-secretase complex genes have been identified in autosomal dominant forms of HS, forming the basis for the hypothesis that Notch signaling is involved in HS pathogenesis. However, these mutations account for only a small minority of HS cases.\nThe immunopathogenesis of HS is poorly understood, with widely and somewhat discordant pathogenic mechanisms proposed. Complement activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HS through elevated concentration of the complement fragment C5a in skin and blood of patients with HS. C5a is a major chemoattractant for neutrophils, a cell population that is prominent in actively inflamed HS skin. Furthermore, increased levels of neutrophils releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in a process called NETosis have been demonstrated in both blood and skin of patients with HS, along with increased type I IFN responses and activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs).\nOther studies have suggested involvement of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17A and IFN-\u03b3, as well as keratinocyte-derived IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Additional transcriptomic studies have noted the increased expression of immunoglobulins and plasma cell signatures in HS, but a clear and comprehensive view of the immunopathogenic mechanisms involved in HS has been lacking. HS remains difficult to treat, with only one biologic therapy, the anti-TNF agent adalimumab, currently approved for its treatment, and even with adalimumab therapeutic responses are suboptimal in nearly 40% of patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for increasing our understanding of this disease to facilitate therapeutic development.\nIn this manuscript we provide potentially novel insights into the immunopathogenesis of HS, using bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing and cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) imaging to outline the major cell types and inflammatory pathways that are dysregulated in HS skin. Our results identify immune complex deposition and complement activation along with B cell and plasma cell activation as critical pathways in HS pathogenesis and provide data suggesting that targeting plasma cell activation could provide a novel therapeutic approach for treating advanced HS.\n\nSection Type: RESULTS\nText: Results\nHS is characterized by enriched biological processes involving complement and B cell responses.\nTwenty-two patients with moderate-to-severe HS and 10 healthy controls (see Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.139930DS1) were enrolled, and lesional (HS) and matching control skin samples were obtained and submitted for bulk RNA-Seq. In addition, RNA-Seq of whole blood (WB) cells was performed on 21 HS patients and 10 healthy controls, with 20 of the HS patients and all the healthy controls having both skin and WB samples profiled. Principal components analyses (PCAs) of skin showed nearly complete separation between HS and healthy control skin (Figure 1A), whereas PBMCs showed less clear separation (Figure 1A). Using a fold change threshold of 2 and false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.1, we detected 4797 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HS skin compared with control skin, of which 2584 were increased and 2213 were decreased. Several genes were found to be increased simultaneously in both HS skin and HS blood. These included CCR4, TNFRSF4, and several genes involved in immunoglobulin biosynthesis (Supplemental Figure 1). The most upregulated genes in skin were associated with B cell responses, including immunoglobulin genes such as IGLV3-27 (100-fold increased, adjusted P = 2.74 \u00d7 10\u20135), CD19 (33-fold, adjusted P = 6.48 \u00d7 10\u201324), and CD79a (32-fold, adjusted P = 3.58 \u00d7 10\u201322). Other genes included the antimicrobial gene DEFB",
		" infiltrates in HS, we used CyTOF imaging to identify and quantify infiltrating leukocytes. HS skin had a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration compared with normal skin (Figure 6A). When visualized using the dimensional reduction tool t-SNE, there was complete separation between the leukocyte clustering in HS skin compared with normal skin, with 12 distinct clusters being observed in HS and 2 clusters in normal (Figure 6B). Markers characterizing each cluster are shown (Figure 6, C and D), with plasma cells being the predominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS skin, followed by B cells, monocyte/macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils (Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that plasma cells and B cells constitute the dominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS. B cell and plasma cell subsets and associated gene transcripts are shown in Supplemental Figure 6.\nHS skin shows increased immunoglobulin production and diversity accompanied by complement activation.\nTo characterize the HS immune repertoire, B cell receptor (BCR) and TCR gene segments and complementarity determining region 3\u2013encoding (CDR3-encoding) sequences were mined from RNA-Seq data sets obtained from skin and blood of HS patients and healthy controls. This analysis revealed that based upon BCR CDR3 sequences and BCR gene segment abundances, there was a significant increase in the frequency of B cells in HS skin (P = 7.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 6.7 \u00d7 10\u20135, 9.8 \u00d7 10\u20135 and P = 8.3 \u00d7 10\u20135, 7.9 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20134 for BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clones per million and BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb gene segment reads per million, respectively) (Figure 7A). Next, to evaluate if there were any qualitative changes in the repertoire, BCR CDR3 alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the Shannon index (Figure 7A). This analysis revealed that the HS BCR repertoire was significantly more diverse than that of control skin (P = 5.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.6 \u00d7 10\u20134, and 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20136 BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clone Shannon diversity, respectively). To further evaluate whether the cutaneous B cell repertoire was qualitatively altered in the setting of HS, Jaccard distances were calculated as a measure of dissimilarity. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots of the beta diversity measures indicated good segregation of samples by disease status for BCR \u03ba and \u03bb light chain (Figure 7B). There was no separation by disease status when this analysis was performed for IgH CDR3 sequences. Thus, at least at the level of the BCR light chain gene rearrangements, there were clear qualitative and quantitative differences in the B cell repertoire of patients with HS. To explore this finding further at the level of individual B cell clones, heatmaps were constructed from data on clone frequencies across HS and healthy control skin. Similar to the PCoA plots, the frequencies of clonal abundance at the level of BCR \u03ba and \u03bb CDR3s across subjects was different enough to separate HS from healthy controls (Figure 7C). To assess deposition of IgGs and complement activation in HS, we stained for components and breakdown products of the complement pathway. This showed prominent protein expression of C1q, C3b, and C4d in HS skin, particularly in the deeper layers of the skin (Figure 7D). Complement receptors CR1 and CR2 were also increased in HS skin, along with IgG immune complex deposition (Figure 7E). To determine if this contributed to the proinflammatory environment in HS, we costained for TNF, the best characterized inflammatory mediator in HS, against B cells (CD20) and plasma cells (CD138). This showed nearly exclusive colocalization of TNF to plasma cells (Figure 7F). Less pronounced shifts in the mRNA expression of TCRs (TRA, TRB, TRD, TRG) was seen, in terms of both total reads and diversity (Supplemental Figure 3).\nBCR and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase signaling are potential therapeutic targets in HS.\nTo validate our transcriptomic findings, we performed IHC of excisional HS tissue of longstanding duration and with prominent sinus formation. This showed positive staining for CD3+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD138+ plasma cells mostly concentrated in the deeper aspect of the biopsy, around a sinus tract (Figure 8A). Analysis of the signal transduction network using literature-based networks (GePS) demonstrated enrichment for BCR signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201325), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201322), and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201313), with enriched signals for IL-17A (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), granzyme B (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), and CCR5 (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20134) (Figure 8B). Activation of these signaling pathways was validated by IHC for phospho-BTK and phospho-SYK (Figure 8C). Network analysis showed prominent clustering of increased HS DEGs around BTK and SYK nodes (Figure 9A). To determine therapeutic potential of these targets in HS, we used IgG/IgM-stimulated B cells, treated with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib, or the SYK inhibitor",
		"ilizumab.\nOther inflammatory mediators implicated in HS include the type I IFNs, based primarily on the expression of IFN response genes, such as MX1, CXCL10, and IFI27. The expression of these was proposed to be driven by NETs interacting with infiltrating pDCs in lesional HS skin. In agreement with this study, we found evidence for both type I and type II IFN responses in our data set, most prominently in 4 of the scRNA-Seq keratinocyte clusters, which notably did not overlap with other clusters having pronounced IL-17 and TNF responses (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Of note, we were unable to detect pDCs in the scRNA-Seq data, and there was no increase in the mRNA expression of any of the type I IFN genes or the pDC markers CD123 or CD303. In contrast, mRNA expression of IFNG was increased by about 2.6-fold, and CXCL10 increased by about 2.7-fold, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 might have a greater contribution to the IFN response in HS than the type I IFNs.\nOur data identified B cells, and in particular plasma cells, as a potential therapeutic target in HS. Strikingly, TNF expression, the target of the only approved biologic treatment in HS, was localized to CD138+ plasma cells (Figure 7G). Successful use of B cell targeting in HS has been reported with the anti-CD20 agent rituximab in a patient undergoing treatment for an unrelated immune disorder. An ex vivo explant study of 10 patients in which skin explants were treated with rituximab demonstrated significant decrease in secretion of several proinflammatory mediators. However, anti-CD20 treatment would be unlikely to target plasma cells, as CD20 is downregulated in plasma cells with CD20 detected only on a small minority of plasma cells. An alternative approach to target plasma cells is to block active signaling pathways in these cells. The most enriched pathways in HS involved B cell signaling, including BCR signaling, SYK, LCK, and BTK (Figure 8A), and these pathways correlated with B cell (CD3) and plasma cell (CD138) infiltration in HS skin but not T cell (CD3) (Figure 8B). Notably, drugs targeting BTK have been shown to prevent plasma cell generation, and SYK has been shown to play a critical role for B cell antibody responses, memory B cell survival, and plasma cell expansion. While our therapeutic data were limited to B cells, they showed decreased B cell expression of several proinflammatory mediators that overlapped with HS skin, including CCL4, and this was more pronounced with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib than the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (Figure 9B). Consistent with an active role of B cells in HS pathogenesis is the observation that these cells are prominent in early HS lesions and are the major immune cell population attenuated with anti-TNF treatment.\nIn summary, while our data have some limitations, including analysis of mostly one ethnicity and lack of perilesional and matched unaffected skin from patients, we provide a comprehensive overview of the inflammatory pathogenesis of HS and help tie together previously discordant data. As there are no animal models of this disease, our data, through identification of potentially novel therapeutic signaling pathways, provide preclinical evidence that should accelerate the path toward clinical trials targeting either BTK or SYK in chronic, moderate-to-severe HS.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: Methods\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing.\nGeneration of single-cell suspensions for scRNA-Seq was performed as follows: lesional HS tissue was obtained from excisional samples from patients with severe HS. Samples were incubated overnight in 0.4% dispase (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Hank\u2019s Balanced Saline Solution (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4\u00b0C. Epidermis and dermis were separated. Epidermis was digested in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10 U/mL DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, quenched with FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), and strained through a 70 \u03bcM mesh. Dermis was minced, digested in 0.2% Collagenase II (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.2% Collagenase V (MilliporeSigma) in plain medium for 1.5 hours at 37\u00b0C, and strained through a 70 \u03bcM mesh. Epidermal and dermal cells were recombined, and libraries were constructed by the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core on the 10x Genomics Chromium system. Libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer to generate 151 bp paired-end reads. Data processing, including quality control, read alignment, and gene quantification, was conducted using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger software. Seurat was used for normalization, data integration, and clustering analysis. Clustered cells were mapped to corresponding cell types by matching cell cluster gene signatures with putative cell type\u2013specific markers.\nRNA-sequencing.\nSkin biopsies of 4 mm in diameter were taken, placed in tubes with RNAlater (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific), stored overnight at 4\u00b0C, and subsequently stored at \u201380\u00b0C until further processing. RNA isolation and sequencing were performed using the Illumina NextSeq platform and sequencing protocols as previously described.

A dot plot showing the top 3 markers for each cluster marked the defining genes for each cluster, although with some overlap between clusters (B). Transcriptomic cytokine responses from several proinflammatory cytokines were used to interrogate each keratinocyte for each particular inflammatory signature, with cluster 7 showing overall the highest and broadest inflammatory signal, but with different specific inflammatory responses having different cluster localization in HS keratinocytes (n = 9) (see Methods) (C).\nIFN-\u03b3 and IL-36 responses are the most prominent keratinocyte immune responses in HS skin.\nSpecific cytokine responses were superimposed on the keratinocyte UMAP clusters to determine the distribution of key cytokine responses across different clusters (A). Circos plots were used to show the connection between the major inflammatory signals (lines) and the specificity (red line) to different keratinocyte clusters (clusters 0\u201312).

Components of the complement pathway (C1q) and breakdown products of activated complement components (C3b, C4d) were increased in HS skin, particularly in the deeper layers of the skin (n = 3) (scale bar: 100 \u03bcm) (D). Complement receptors, CR1 and CR2, were increased in the deeper layers of HS, along with IgG1 immune complex deposition (n = 3) (scale bar: 100 \u03bcm) (E).

To confirm the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate in HS and the localization of components of the enriched signaling pathways, we performed IHC in an excisional biopsy for CD3, CD20, and CD138. Plasma cells were the predominant inflammatory infiltrate and most prominent in the deeper layers of the skin surrounding a deeper sinus tract (A), accompanied by increased expression of BTK, SYK, and LCK (B) (n = 3). Activation of key components of this signaling pathway was confirmed by IHC for both phospho-BTK and phospho-SYK (n = 3) (C).\nB cell receptor signaling is central to HS transcriptomic changes and a potential therapeutic target in HS.\nOutline of the GePS network in HS skin centered on critical inflammatory nodes, including BTK, SYK, JUN, and STAT1 signaling (red/brown indicating increased expression and green indicating decreased expression) (A).

		" infiltrates in HS, we used CyTOF imaging to identify and quantify infiltrating leukocytes. HS skin had a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration compared with normal skin (Figure 6A). When visualized using the dimensional reduction tool t-SNE, there was complete separation between the leukocyte clustering in HS skin compared with normal skin, with 12 distinct clusters being observed in HS and 2 clusters in normal (Figure 6B). Markers characterizing each cluster are shown (Figure 6, C and D), with plasma cells being the predominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS skin, followed by B cells, monocyte/macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils (Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that plasma cells and B cells constitute the dominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS. B cell and plasma cell subsets and associated gene transcripts are shown in Supplemental Figure 6.\nHS skin shows increased immunoglobulin production and diversity accompanied by complement activation.\nTo characterize the HS immune repertoire, B cell receptor (BCR) and TCR gene segments and complementarity determining region 3\u2013encoding (CDR3-encoding) sequences were mined from RNA-Seq data sets obtained from skin and blood of HS patients and healthy controls. This analysis revealed that based upon BCR CDR3 sequences and BCR gene segment abundances, there was a significant increase in the frequency of B cells in HS skin (P = 7.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 6.7 \u00d7 10\u20135, 9.8 \u00d7 10\u20135 and P = 8.3 \u00d7 10\u20135, 7.9 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20134 for BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clones per million and BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb gene segment reads per million, respectively) (Figure 7A). Next, to evaluate if there were any qualitative changes in the repertoire, BCR CDR3 alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the Shannon index (Figure 7A). This analysis revealed that the HS BCR repertoire was significantly more diverse than that of control skin (P = 5.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.6 \u00d7 10\u20134, and 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20136 BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clone Shannon diversity, respectively). To further evaluate whether the cutaneous B cell repertoire was qualitatively altered in the setting of HS, Jaccard distances were calculated as a measure of dissimilarity. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots of the beta diversity measures indicated good segregation of samples by disease status for BCR \u03ba and \u03bb light chain (Figure 7B). There was no separation by disease status when this analysis was performed for IgH CDR3 sequences. Thus, at least at the level of the BCR light chain gene rearrangements, there were clear qualitative and quantitative differences in the B cell repertoire of patients with HS. To explore this finding further at the level of individual B cell clones, heatmaps were constructed from data on clone frequencies across HS and healthy control skin. Similar to the PCoA plots, the frequencies of clonal abundance at the level of BCR \u03ba and \u03bb CDR3s across subjects was different enough to separate HS from healthy controls (Figure 7C). To assess deposition of IgGs and complement activation in HS, we stained for components and breakdown products of the complement pathway. This showed prominent protein expression of C1q, C3b, and C4d in HS skin, particularly in the deeper layers of the skin (Figure 7D). Complement receptors CR1 and CR2 were also increased in HS skin, along with IgG immune complex deposition (Figure 7E). To determine if this contributed to the proinflammatory environment in HS, we costained for TNF, the best characterized inflammatory mediator in HS, against B cells (CD20) and plasma cells (CD138). This showed nearly exclusive colocalization of TNF to plasma cells (Figure 7F). Less pronounced shifts in the mRNA expression of TCRs (TRA, TRB, TRD, TRG) was seen, in terms of both total reads and diversity (Supplemental Figure 3).\nBCR and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase signaling are potential therapeutic targets in HS.\nTo validate our transcriptomic findings, we performed IHC of excisional HS tissue of longstanding duration and with prominent sinus formation. This showed positive staining for CD3+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD138+ plasma cells mostly concentrated in the deeper aspect of the biopsy, around a sinus tract (Figure 8A). Analysis of the signal transduction network using literature-based networks (GePS) demonstrated enrichment for BCR signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201325), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201322), and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201313), with enriched signals for IL-17A (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), granzyme B (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), and CCR5 (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20134) (Figure 8B). Activation of these signaling pathways was validated by IHC for phospho-BTK and phospho-SYK (Figure 8C). Network analysis showed prominent clustering of increased HS DEGs around BTK and SYK nodes (Figure 9A). To determine therapeutic potential of these targets in HS, we used IgG/IgM-stimulated B cells, treated with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib, or the SYK inhibitor",
		"ilizumab.\nOther inflammatory mediators implicated in HS include the type I IFNs, based primarily on the expression of IFN response genes, such as MX1, CXCL10, and IFI27. The expression of these was proposed to be driven by NETs interacting with infiltrating pDCs in lesional HS skin. In agreement with this study, we found evidence for both type I and type II IFN responses in our data set, most prominently in 4 of the scRNA-Seq keratinocyte clusters, which notably did not overlap with other clusters having pronounced IL-17 and TNF responses (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Of note, we were unable to detect pDCs in the scRNA-Seq data, and there was no increase in the mRNA expression of any of the type I IFN genes or the pDC markers CD123 or CD303. In contrast, mRNA expression of IFNG was increased by about 2.6-fold, and CXCL10 increased by about 2.7-fold, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 might have a greater contribution to the IFN response in HS than the type I IFNs.\nOur data identified B cells, and in particular plasma cells, as a potential therapeutic target in HS. Strikingly, TNF expression, the target of the only approved biologic treatment in HS, was localized to CD138+ plasma cells (Figure 7G). Successful use of B cell targeting in HS has been reported with the anti-CD20 agent rituximab in a patient undergoing treatment for an unrelated immune disorder. An ex vivo explant study of 10 patients in which skin explants were treated with rituximab demonstrated significant decrease in secretion of several proinflammatory mediators. However, anti-CD20 treatment would be unlikely to target plasma cells, as CD20 is downregulated in plasma cells with CD20 detected only on a small minority of plasma cells. An alternative approach to target plasma cells is to block active signaling pathways in these cells. The most enriched pathways in HS involved B cell signaling, including BCR signaling, SYK, LCK, and BTK (Figure 8A), and these pathways correlated with B cell (CD3) and plasma cell (CD138) infiltration in HS skin but not T cell (CD3) (Figure 8B). Notably, drugs targeting BTK have been shown to prevent plasma cell generation, and SYK has been shown to play a critical role for B cell antibody responses, memory B cell survival, and plasma cell expansion. While our therapeutic data were limited to B cells, they showed decreased B cell expression of several proinflammatory mediators that overlapped with HS skin, including CCL4, and this was more pronounced with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib than the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (Figure 9B). Consistent with an active role of B cells in HS pathogenesis is the observation that these cells are prominent in early HS lesions and are the major immune cell population attenuated with anti-TNF treatment.\nIn summary, while our data have some limitations, including analysis of mostly one ethnicity and lack of perilesional and matched unaffected skin from patients, we provide a comprehensive overview of the inflammatory pathogenesis of HS and help tie together previously discordant data. As there are no animal models of this disease, our data, through identification of potentially novel therapeutic signaling pathways, provide preclinical evidence that should accelerate the path toward clinical trials targeting either BTK or SYK in chronic, moderate-to-severe HS.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: Methods\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing.\nGeneration of single-cell suspensions for scRNA-Seq was performed as follows: lesional HS tissue was obtained from excisional samples from patients with severe HS. Samples were incubated overnight in 0.4% dispase (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Hank\u2019s Balanced Saline Solution (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4\u00b0C. Epidermis and dermis were separated. Epidermis was digested in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10 U/mL DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, quenched with FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), and strained through a 70 \u03bcM mesh. Dermis was minced, digested in 0.2% Collagenase II (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.2% Collagenase V (MilliporeSigma) in plain medium for 1.5 hours at 37\u00b0C, and strained through a 70 \u03bcM mesh. Epidermal and dermal cells were recombined, and libraries were constructed by the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core on the 10x Genomics Chromium system. Libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer to generate 151 bp paired-end reads. Data processing, including quality control, read alignment, and gene quantification, was conducted using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger software.

The heatmap was constructed using Euclidean distance with complete linkage on centered data using the top clones showing greatest variance. Alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the Shannon diversity index using the vegan software package in R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/index.html). The Shannon diversity index quantifies diversity through the incorporation of both evenness and richness, with higher values representing more even populations of TCR- or BCR-rich samples. The differences in beta diversity were assessed based on Jaccard distances calculated using the vegan software package in R. To visualize the Jaccard dissimilarities between the samples, PCoA using R package ape was performed.\nCyTOF imaging.\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue slides obtained from HS patients and healthy controls were heated for 2 hours at 60\u00b0C, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. Slides were placed in pH 9 Tris/EDTA antigen retrieval buffer and heated at 96\u00b0C for 30 minutes. After cooling, slides were blocked in 3% BSA and stained with a cocktail of metal-tagged antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C, including CD14 (EPR3653, Abcam), CD16 (EPR16784, Abcam), CD68 (KP1, BioLegend), CD15 (W6D3, Fluidigm), CD31 (JC/70A, Novus), CD45 (2B11, Novus), E-Cadherin (24E10, Fluidigm), CD20 (L26, Novus), CD8 (C8/144B, Fluidigm), collagen (polyclonal, Fluidigm), CD27 (EPR8569, Abcam), CD103 [EPR4166, Abcam], CD138 (MI15, BioLegend), and pan-actin (D18C11, Cell Signaling Technology). The slides were then washed with 0.2% Triton X-100 and stained with Intercalator-Ir (Fluidigm) for 30 minutes at room temperature in a hydration chamber. The stained tissue was ablated and raw data were acquired on the Hyperion Imaging System (Fluidigm).\nCyTOF imaging data analysis.\nMultiplexed CyTOF imaging data were preprocessed using commercial acquisition software (Fluidigm) and converted to.TIFF images. These images were then segmented into individual cells using CellProfiler v3.1.8 for single-cell analysis. The t-SNE dimensionality reduction algorithm and the Phenograph unsupervised clustering algorithm were performed on 12 markers (CD20, CD15, CD27, CD68, CD16, CD14, CD138, CD31, CD103, CD45, CD3, and CD8) using HistoCAT v1.75 software. For t-SNE and Phenograph, the data were normalized to the 99th percentile. The heatmap shows Z-scored mean marker expression of each cluster. P values were computed using 2-tailed Student\u2019s t tests assuming homoscedasticity.\nImmunohistochemistry.\nParaffin-embedded tissue sections from excisional biopsies from patients with hidradenitis and healthy control skin were heated at 60\u00b0C for 30 minutes, deparaffinized, and rehydrated. Slides were placed in pH 6 antigen retrieval buffer and heated at 125\u00b0C for 30 seconds in a pressure cooker water bath. After cooling, slides were treated with 3% H2O2 (5 minutes) and blocked using 10% goat serum (30 minutes). Overnight incubation (4\u00b0C) was performed using CR1 (CD35) (LifeSpan Biosciences, catalog LS-C675585, 5 \u03bcg/mL) and CR2 (CD21) (LifeSpan Biosciences, catalog LS-C167018, concentration 1:50). Staining done in antigen retrieval buffer at pH 9 included IgG1 (Abcam, catalog ab233885, 5 \u03bcg/mL), phospho-SYK (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog C87C1, 1:100), phospho-BTK (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog 14-9015-82, ",
		" infiltrates in HS, we used CyTOF imaging to identify and quantify infiltrating leukocytes. HS skin had a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration compared with normal skin (Figure 6A). When visualized using the dimensional reduction tool t-SNE, there was complete separation between the leukocyte clustering in HS skin compared with normal skin, with 12 distinct clusters being observed in HS and 2 clusters in normal (Figure 6B). Markers characterizing each cluster are shown (Figure 6, C and D), with plasma cells being the predominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS skin, followed by B cells, monocyte/macrophages, CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils (Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that plasma cells and B cells constitute the dominant infiltrating leukocyte population in HS. B cell and plasma cell subsets and associated gene transcripts are shown in Supplemental Figure 6.\nHS skin shows increased immunoglobulin production and diversity accompanied by complement activation.\nTo characterize the HS immune repertoire, B cell receptor (BCR) and TCR gene segments and complementarity determining region 3\u2013encoding (CDR3-encoding) sequences were mined from RNA-Seq data sets obtained from skin and blood of HS patients and healthy controls. This analysis revealed that based upon BCR CDR3 sequences and BCR gene segment abundances, there was a significant increase in the frequency of B cells in HS skin (P = 7.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 6.7 \u00d7 10\u20135, 9.8 \u00d7 10\u20135 and P = 8.3 \u00d7 10\u20135, 7.9 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20134 for BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clones per million and BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb gene segment reads per million, respectively) (Figure 7A). Next, to evaluate if there were any qualitative changes in the repertoire, BCR CDR3 alpha diversity was assessed by calculating the Shannon index (Figure 7A). This analysis revealed that the HS BCR repertoire was significantly more diverse than that of control skin (P = 5.8 \u00d7 10\u20135, 1.6 \u00d7 10\u20134, and 1.4 \u00d7 10\u20136 BCR IgH, \u03ba, \u03bb clone Shannon diversity, respectively). To further evaluate whether the cutaneous B cell repertoire was qualitatively altered in the setting of HS, Jaccard distances were calculated as a measure of dissimilarity. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) plots of the beta diversity measures indicated good segregation of samples by disease status for BCR \u03ba and \u03bb light chain (Figure 7B). There was no separation by disease status when this analysis was performed for IgH CDR3 sequences. Thus, at least at the level of the BCR light chain gene rearrangements, there were clear qualitative and quantitative differences in the B cell repertoire of patients with HS. To explore this finding further at the level of individual B cell clones, heatmaps were constructed from data on clone frequencies across HS and healthy control skin. Similar to the PCoA plots, the frequencies of clonal abundance at the level of BCR \u03ba and \u03bb CDR3s across subjects was different enough to separate HS from healthy controls (Figure 7C). To assess deposition of IgGs and complement activation in HS, we stained for components and breakdown products of the complement pathway. This showed prominent protein expression of C1q, C3b, and C4d in HS skin, particularly in the deeper layers of the skin (Figure 7D). Complement receptors CR1 and CR2 were also increased in HS skin, along with IgG immune complex deposition (Figure 7E). To determine if this contributed to the proinflammatory environment in HS, we costained for TNF, the best characterized inflammatory mediator in HS, against B cells (CD20) and plasma cells (CD138). This showed nearly exclusive colocalization of TNF to plasma cells (Figure 7F). Less pronounced shifts in the mRNA expression of TCRs (TRA, TRB, TRD, TRG) was seen, in terms of both total reads and diversity (Supplemental Figure 3).\nBCR and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase signaling are potential therapeutic targets in HS.\nTo validate our transcriptomic findings, we performed IHC of excisional HS tissue of longstanding duration and with prominent sinus formation. This showed positive staining for CD3+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD138+ plasma cells mostly concentrated in the deeper aspect of the biopsy, around a sinus tract (Figure 8A). Analysis of the signal transduction network using literature-based networks (GePS) demonstrated enrichment for BCR signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201325), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201322), and Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201313), with enriched signals for IL-17A (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), granzyme B (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20137), and CCR5 (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u20134) (Figure 8B). Activation of these signaling pathways was validated by IHC for phospho-BTK and phospho-SYK (Figure 8C). Network analysis showed prominent clustering of increased HS DEGs around BTK and SYK nodes (Figure 9A). To determine therapeutic potential of these targets in HS, we used IgG/IgM-stimulated B cells, treated with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib, or the SYK inhibitor",
		"ilizumab.\nOther inflammatory mediators implicated in HS include the type I IFNs, based primarily on the expression of IFN response genes, such as MX1, CXCL10, and IFI27. The expression of these was proposed to be driven by NETs interacting with infiltrating pDCs in lesional HS skin. In agreement with this study, we found evidence for both type I and type II IFN responses in our data set, most prominently in 4 of the scRNA-Seq keratinocyte clusters, which notably did not overlap with other clusters having pronounced IL-17 and TNF responses (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Of note, we were unable to detect pDCs in the scRNA-Seq data, and there was no increase in the mRNA expression of any of the type I IFN genes or the pDC markers CD123 or CD303. In contrast, mRNA expression of IFNG was increased by about 2.6-fold, and CXCL10 increased by about 2.7-fold, suggesting that IFN-\u03b3 might have a greater contribution to the IFN response in HS than the type I IFNs.\nOur data identified B cells, and in particular plasma cells, as a potential therapeutic target in HS. Strikingly, TNF expression, the target of the only approved biologic treatment in HS, was localized to CD138+ plasma cells (Figure 7G). Successful use of B cell targeting in HS has been reported with the anti-CD20 agent rituximab in a patient undergoing treatment for an unrelated immune disorder. An ex vivo explant study of 10 patients in which skin explants were treated with rituximab demonstrated significant decrease in secretion of several proinflammatory mediators. However, anti-CD20 treatment would be unlikely to target plasma cells, as CD20 is downregulated in plasma cells with CD20 detected only on a small minority of plasma cells. An alternative approach to target plasma cells is to block active signaling pathways in these cells. The most enriched pathways in HS involved B cell signaling, including BCR signaling, SYK, LCK, and BTK (Figure 8A), and these pathways correlated with B cell (CD3) and plasma cell (CD138) infiltration in HS skin but not T cell (CD3) (Figure 8B). Notably, drugs targeting BTK have been shown to prevent plasma cell generation, and SYK has been shown to play a critical role for B cell antibody responses, memory B cell survival, and plasma cell expansion. While our therapeutic data were limited to B cells, they showed decreased B cell expression of several proinflammatory mediators that overlapped with HS skin, including CCL4, and this was more pronounced with the BTK inhibitors acalabrutinib and ibrutinib than the SYK inhibitor fostamatinib (Figure 9B). Consistent with an active role of B cells in HS pathogenesis is the observation that these cells are prominent in early HS lesions and are the major immune cell population attenuated with anti-TNF treatment.\nIn summary, while our data have some limitations, including analysis of mostly one ethnicity and lack of perilesional and matched unaffected skin from patients, we provide a comprehensive overview of the inflammatory pathogenesis of HS and help tie together previously discordant data. As there are no animal models of this disease, our data, through identification of potentially novel therapeutic signaling pathways, provide preclinical evidence that should accelerate the path toward clinical trials targeting either BTK or SYK in chronic, moderate-to-severe HS.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: Methods\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing.\nGeneration of single-cell suspensions for scRNA-Seq was performed as follows: lesional HS tissue was obtained from excisional samples from patients with severe HS. Samples were incubated overnight in 0.4% dispase (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in Hank\u2019s Balanced Saline Solution (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4\u00b0C. Epidermis and dermis were separated. Epidermis was digested in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 10 U/mL DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, quenched with FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), and strained through a 70 \u03bcM mesh. Dermis was minced, digested in 0.2% Collagenase II (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.2% Collagenase V (MilliporeSigma) in plain medium for 1.5 hours at 37\u00b0C, and strained through a 70 \u03bcM mesh. Epidermal and dermal cells were recombined, and libraries were constructed by the University of Michigan Advanced Genomics Core on the 10x Genomics Chromium system. Libraries were then sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer to generate 151 bp paired-end reads. Data processing, including quality control, read alignment, and gene quantification, was conducted using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger software. Seurat was used for normalization, data integration, and clustering analysis. Clustered cells were mapped to corresponding cell types by matching cell cluster gene signatures with putative cell type\u2013specific markers.\nRNA-sequencing.\nSkin biopsies of 4 mm in diameter were taken, placed in tubes with RNAlater (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific), stored overnight at 4\u00b0C, and subsequently stored at \u201380\u00b0C until further processing. RNA isolation and sequencing were performed using the Illumina NextSeq platform and sequencing protocols as previously described. For RNA-Seq analyses, adapter trimming and quality control were conducted on the raw sequence reads. The paired-end reads were mapped",

A dot plot showing the top 3 markers for each cluster marked the defining genes for each cluster, although with some overlap between clusters (B).

To confirm the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate in HS and the localization of components of the enriched signaling pathways, we performed IHC in an excisional biopsy for CD3, CD20, and CD138. Plasma cells were the predominant inflammatory infiltrate and most prominent in the deeper layers of the skin surrounding a deeper sinus tract (A), accompanied by increased expression of BTK, SYK, and LCK (B) (n = 3).

No significant difference was observed between patients with SSc and controls for the rs844665 variant.\nAnalysis of the 5-SNP marker set (rs1234314, rs2205960, rs844644, rs844648, rs844665) in the TNFSF4 revealed 5 out of 28 specific 5-marker haplotypes that were associated with SSc (table 3). Four risk haplotypes were identified: C-G-A-A-C (p<10\u22124), G-G-C-G-C (p=0.0006), G-G-C-G-T (p<10\u22124) and G-T-C-G-C (p<10\u22124). Consistent with the individual SNP 3\u00d72 \u03c72 analysis, the C-G-A-G-C was found to be protective for the development of SSc (p<10\u22124). These data support the genetic associations of SNPs in TNFSF4 with SSc susceptibility observed in the case-control comparisons in table 2.\nTNFSF4 polymorphisms and association with subsets of SSc\nSSc is a clinically heterogeneous disease that is divided into two main clinical subsets based on the extent of cutaneous involvement: limited (lSSc) and diffuse (dSSc). Furthermore, the presence of SSc-associated autoantibodies such as ACA, ATA and ARA is associated with distinct clinical subsets characterised by extent of cutaneous involvement and pattern of organ involvement. Several studies have recently shown that certain genetic polymorphisms may have stronger associations with particular phenotypic subsets. Therefore, we compared the frequency of TNFSF4 SNPs within the clinical and autoantibody subsets of patients with SSc (table 4).\nThe minor alleles at TNFSF4 SNPs rs1234314 and rs2205960 were more common in lSSc compared to controls. No differences were observed with rs844644 and rs844648 between lSSc and controls. Compared to controls, the patients with dSSc had an increased frequency of the minor alleles at TNFSF4 SNPs rs1234314, rs2205960 and rs844648 and decreased frequency of the minor allele at rs844644. Comparison of patients with and without pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension did not reveal any differences in the frequency of the SNPs in the TNFSF4 gene region.\nUsing the SSc-associated autoantibodies to subset patients with SSc, a significant association was observed with rs1234214 and ACA-positive (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6) and ATA-positive patients with SSc (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.7) compared to controls. The minor allele at rs2205960 was more frequent in ATA-positive SSc compared to controls (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.9). Interestingly, only rs844648 was noted to be associated with ARA-positive SSc compared to controls (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8). No significant differences were noted in the SSc-associated autoantibody subsets of SSc compared to controls at rs844644.\nAdditional analyses were performed using logistic regression with gender added to the model (figure 2). The strongest associations were observed with rs2205960, where the minor allele was observed with increased frequency in lSSc and dSSc as well as the autoantibody subsets. The minor allele at rs844644 was protective in all groups except for the patients who were ARA positive. With regards to rs1234314, the associations remained in lSSc, ACA and ATA groups. However, the association of rs1234314 was no longer observed after controlling for gender in the logistic regression analyses. Lastly, with regards to rs844648, logistic regression confirmed the association with dSSc and ARA. Together these data suggest that different polymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene region are associated with susceptibility to the distinct autoantibody and skin subsets in SSc.\nCART analysis for SNP interaction in the TNFSF4 gene region\nTo identify the SNP(s) in TNFSF4 that play a more prominent role in SSc susceptibility, CART analysis was performed. Accordingly, the five TNFSF4 polymorphisms and gender were entered as variables in the CART model. CART analysis interactively segregates participants into two subgroups using the most powerful variable classifier for SSc.\nFigure 3 depicts female gender as the first split. In women, the \u2018TT/GT\u2019 genotype of the TNFSF4 variant (rs2205960) increased risk for SSc as compared to the \u2018GG\u2019 wild-type genotype (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9) consistent with a dominant model.

The individuals with wild-type genotype \u2018GG\u2019 at rs2205960 were subsequently further split by the TNFSF4 variant (rs855648) into two subgroups: the \u2018AA\u2019 genotype of the TNFSF4 variant increased risk for SSc as compared to the \u2018AG/GG\u2019 genotypes (OR=2.55, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.3). Therefore, this analysis uncovered a potential interaction between the rs2205960 and rs855648 SNPs in the TNFSF4 gene region among women patients with SSc. This interaction between the two TNFSF4 variants, rs2205960 and rs855648, was further tested and confirmed by an interaction model in logistic regression analysis (p=0.0004).\n\nSection Type: TABLE\nText: Clinical and serological characteristics of patients with systemic sclerosis\nCharacteristic\tValue\t \tControls:\t \tGender\t(N=698)*\t \t\u2003Female\t334 (50.8)\t \t\u2003Male\t323 (49.2)\t \tSystemic sclerosis:\t \tGender\t(N=1059)\t \t\u2003Female\t935 (88.3)\t \t\u2003Male\t124 (11.7)\t \tSkin involvement\t(N=1004)\t \t\u2003Limited systemic sclerosis\t611 (60.9)\t \t\u2003Diffuse systemic sclerosis\t393 (39.1)\t \tSSc-associated autoantibodies\t(N=1059)\t \t\u2003Anti-centromere\t300 (28.3)\t \t\u2003Anti-topoisomerase I\t174 (16.4)\t \t\u2003Anti-RNA polymerase III\t193 (18.2)\t \t\u2003Neither anti-centromere, anti-topoisomerase I, or anti-RNA polymerase III\t392 (37.1)\t \t\nValues are number (%).\nMissing gender information on 41 controls.\nDistribution of the tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4) SNP genotype in North American Caucasian patients with SSc and normal controls*\n\t\tMAF (%)\tAllelic \u03c72 p value and OR\t \tSNP (minor allele)\tPosition (bp)\tControls (N=698)\tSSc (N=1059)\tpU\tpFDR\tOR (95% CI)\t \trs1234314 (G)\t171444015\t41.3\t45.8\t0.01\t0.019\t1.20 (1.04 to 1.4)\t \trs2205960 (T)\t171458098\t21.2\t25.0\t0.01\t0.019\t1.24 (1.1 to 1.5)\t \trs844644 (A)\t171476118\t49.1\t44.7\t0.01\t0.019\t0.84 (0.7 to 0.97)\t \trs844648 (A)\t171490486\t41.4\t45.2\t0.03\t0.038\t1.16 (1.01 to 1.3)\t \trs844665 (T)\t171515580\t7.3\t8.3\t0.31\t0.31\t1.19 (0.9 to 1.5)\t \t\nControls are used as reference for all comparisons. bp, base pairs; MAF, minor allele frequency; pFDR, corrected p values using Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate method; pU, uncorrected \u03c72 p values; SSc, systemic sclerosis; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.\nHaplotype analysis of the 5-SNP marker set in the tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4) in Caucasian patients with SSc and controls\nHaplotype*\tControls (N=694)\tSSc (N=1050)\t\u03c72\tpU\tEffect direction\t \tOMNIBUS\tNA\tNA\t164.3\t<0.0001\t\t \tC-G-A-A-C\t0.6%\t4.9%\t52.6\t<0.0001\tRisk\t \tC-G-A-G-C\t43.4%\t35.1%\t25.3\t<0.0001\tProtective\t \tG-G-C-G-C\t0.4%\t1.7%\t12.1\t0.0006\tRisk\t \tG-G-C-G-T\t0.0%\t1.4%\t20.6\t<0.0001\tRisk\t \tG-T-C-G-C\t0.6%\t3.9%\t37.6\t<0.0001\tRisk\t \tOthers\u2020\t55.0%\t53.0%\t\t\tNeutral\t \t\nThe order of the SNPs is rs1234314\u2013rs2205960\u2013rs844644\u2013rs844648\u2013rs844665.\nIncludes 23 other haplotypes.\nNA, not applicable; pU, uncorrected \u03c72 p values; SSc, systemic sclerosis; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.\nDistribution of the tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4) SNP alleles in North American Caucasian patients with SSc and normal controls*\n",
		"Section Type: TITLE\nText: Association of TNFSF4 (OX40L) polymorphisms with susceptibility to systemic sclerosis\n\nSection Type: ABSTRACT\nText: Objective\nIt is increasingly being appreciated that multiple autoimmune diseases share common susceptibility genes. The tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4, OX40L), which encodes for the T cell costimulatory molecule OX40 ligand, has been identified as a susceptibility gene for the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to investigate the possible association of the TNFSF4 gene region with systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune disease that leads to the development of cutaneous and visceral fibrosis.\nMethods\nA total of 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TNFSF4 gene region, previously associated with susceptibility to SLE, were tested for association with SSc in a collection of 1059 patients with SSc and 698 controls.\nResults\nCase-control comparisons revealed a significant association between susceptibility to SSc and the minor alleles at SNPs rs1234314 (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.4, pFDR=0.019), rs2205960 (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.50, pFDR=0.019) and rs844648 (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.30, pFDR=0.032). The minor allele at rs844644 was protective (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.97, pFDR=0.038). Analysis of subsets of patients with SSc demonstrated significant associations of the TNFSF4 SNPs with limited and diffuse SSc as well as specific SNPs that were associated with SSc-associated autoantibodies. Finally, the analyses suggest a potential interaction between two TNFSF4 SNPs, rs2205960 and rs844648, with regards to SSc susceptibility.\nConclusions\nPolymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene region are associated with susceptibility to SSc and its clinical and autoantibody subsets. TNFSF4 may be another gene that confers risk to multiple autoimmune diseases.\n\nSection Type: INTRO\nText: Introduction\nRecently, a number of reports have identified genes that are associated with the development of multiple autoimmune diseases suggesting that autoimmune diseases share genetic risk factors. For example, PTPN22 has been associated with the development of type I diabetes mellitus (TIDM), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). STAT4 is a susceptibility gene for the development of SLE and RA. Together these studies implicate dysregulation of common immune pathways due to polymorphisms in several genes in the development of a variety of autoimmune diseases.\nThe tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4, OX40L), which encodes for the costimulatory molecule OX40 ligand, has been identified as a susceptibility gene for SLE in multiple studies. To date, polymorphisms in TNFSF4 also have been associated with atherosclerosis, but there are no published reports of the association of TNFSF4 with autoimmune diseases such as RA, TIDM, or systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, SSc).\nSSc is a chronic multisystem disease clinically characterised by progressive fibrosis in the skin and internal organs. Pathologically, SSc exhibits three cardinal features: inflammation and autoimmunity, vasculopathy and excessive extracellular matrix deposition. The immune alterations that lead to the development of SSc are unknown, but multiple lines of evidence suggest that SSc may share common immune alterations with SLE. For example, similar to SLE, patients with SSc have a myriad of circulating antinuclear antibodies. Furthermore, peripheral blood cells from a subset of patients with SLE and SSc have a pattern of upregulation of type I interferon associated gene transcripts. These data now have been extended at the genetic level where SLE and SSc have been associated with polymorphisms in the interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) gene, STAT4, PTPN22 and FAS. \nGiven the association of polymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene region with susceptibility to SLE as well as the potential common alterations in immune function and related genes between SLE and SSc, the current study sought to determine if polymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene region are associated with SSc susceptibility in a large case-control study of North American Caucasian patients with SSc and healthy controls.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: Methods\nPatients with SSc and controls\nA total of 1059 Caucasian patients with SSc and 698 healthy Caucasian controls from the Scleroderma Family Registry and DNA Repository and the University of Texas Rheumatology Division, dating from 1986 to present, including the Genetics versus Environment in Scleroderma Outcomes Study (GENISOS) formed the current cohort. All patients with SSc fulfilled American College of Rheumatology (ACR) preliminary criteria for disease classification or had at least three of the five CREST (for \u2018Calcinosis, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, Eesophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasias') features.

Patients were not excluded if they had symptoms of myositis or Sjogren's syndrome. Patients in the registry were excluded if they met ACR criteria for SLE. In the division samples, one patient was subsequently diagnosed as having SLE. The patients were classified as limited or diffuse cutaneous SSc according to published criteria. All participants provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of The University of Texas Health Science Centre at Houston.\nAutoantibody analysis\nTesting for antinuclear antibodies was performed using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and HEp-2 cells as antigen substrate (Antibodies Inc, Davis, California, USA). Anti-centromere antibodies (ACA) were determined by their distinctive IIF pattern on HEp-2 cells. Autoantibodies to topoisomerase I (ATA) were determined by passive immunodiffusion (Inova Diagnostics, San Diego, California, USA). Anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies (ARA) were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay (MBL, Nagoya, Japan).\nSNP selection and genotyping\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TNFSF4 gene region were selected based on TNFSF4 variants identified in two independent candidate gene studies in SLE. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood with the PureGene genomic DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). The following TNFSF4 SNPs were genotyped: rs1234314, rs1234315, rs2205960, rs844644, rs12039904, rs2795288, rs844648, rs844665 and rs10912580, using an ABI TaqMan SNP genotyping assay from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, California, USA). ABI 7900HT real-time thermocycler was used to perform the plate reading. Automated allele calling was performed by allelic discrimination plots using SDS V.2.3 software (Applied Biosystems). Multiple positive (Centre d\u2019Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) samples) and negative controls were used in each genotyping assay and allele calls were verified with HapMap data for validation.\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed using SAS V.9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA) software. Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) testing was performed using the exact test for HWE. Allelic and genotypic associations were calculated using the standard Pearson \u03c72 test or Fisher exact test. Statistical significance was considered at p<0.05 after correcting for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate method (pFDR). Logistic regression analysis was performed to confirm these associations. Measures of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) were determined using Haploview (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA). SAS was used for overall (\u2018omnibus test\u2019) haplotype frequency tests as well as for haplotype-specific tests. The \u2018omnibus test\u2019 was evaluated to detect differences in overall haplotype frequency profiles between SSc and controls. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was performed to explore interactions between SNPs (CART V.6.0; Salford Systems, San Diego, California, USA) using gender and SNPs of TNFSF4 as nominal categorical variables to predict the outcome of SSc. Logistic regression analysis was performed to verify the SNP interaction observed in CART analysis.\n\nSection Type: RESULTS\nText: Results\nLinkage disequilibrium in the TNFSF4 gene region in healthy controls\nA candidate gene association study was conducted using 1059 Caucasian patients with SSc and 698 healthy controls. Clinical and serological data for the patients with SSc are presented in table 1. Nine TNFSF4 SNPs previously associated with susceptibility to SLE were genotyped in patients with SSc and controls. All SNPs studied in the TNFSF4 gene region were in HWE in Caucasian controls (see supplementary material). Pairwise LD was calculated by D\u2032 and r2 for TNFSF4 SNPs typed in Caucasian controls (figure 1). The TNFSF4 SNPs rs1234314\u2013rs1234315, rs2205960\u2013rs12039904, rs2205960\u2013rs10912580, rs12039904\u2013rs10912580 and rs2795288\u2013rs844648 showed LD in the Caucasian population (r2 \u22650.80). Given the tight LD of these SNPs, rs1234315, rs12039904, rs10912580 and rs2795288 were not used in subsequent analyses and the case-control comparisons were performed on the remaining five SNPs tagging the TNFSF4 region.\nTNFSF4 polymorphisms and association with SSc\nCase-control comparisons for genotypes using the \u03c72 test demonstrated significant association for multiple SNPs in the TNFSF4 gene region (table 2). These associations remained significant even after controlling for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method. Compared to controls, patients with SSc had a higher frequency of the minor allele at rs1234314 (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.4), rs2205960 (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5) and rs844648 (OR 1.2",

		" region (table 2). These associations remained significant even after controlling for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate method. Compared to controls, patients with SSc had a higher frequency of the minor allele at rs1234314 (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.4), rs2205960 (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5) and rs844648 (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.3). The minor allele frequency at rs844648 was less common in patients with SSc compared to controls (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.97). These data were confirmed using logistic regression analyses after controlling for gender (figure 2). No significant difference was observed between patients with SSc and controls for the rs844665 variant.\nAnalysis of the 5-SNP marker set (rs1234314, rs2205960, rs844644, rs844648, rs844665) in the TNFSF4 revealed 5 out of 28 specific 5-marker haplotypes that were associated with SSc (table 3). Four risk haplotypes were identified: C-G-A-A-C (p<10\u22124), G-G-C-G-C (p=0.0006), G-G-C-G-T (p<10\u22124) and G-T-C-G-C (p<10\u22124). Consistent with the individual SNP 3\u00d72 \u03c72 analysis, the C-G-A-G-C was found to be protective for the development of SSc (p<10\u22124). These data support the genetic associations of SNPs in TNFSF4 with SSc susceptibility observed in the case-control comparisons in table 2.\nTNFSF4 polymorphisms and association with subsets of SSc\nSSc is a clinically heterogeneous disease that is divided into two main clinical subsets based on the extent of cutaneous involvement: limited (lSSc) and diffuse (dSSc). Furthermore, the presence of SSc-associated autoantibodies such as ACA, ATA and ARA is associated with distinct clinical subsets characterised by extent of cutaneous involvement and pattern of organ involvement. Several studies have recently shown that certain genetic polymorphisms may have stronger associations with particular phenotypic subsets. Therefore, we compared the frequency of TNFSF4 SNPs within the clinical and autoantibody subsets of patients with SSc (table 4).\nThe minor alleles at TNFSF4 SNPs rs1234314 and rs2205960 were more common in lSSc compared to controls. No differences were observed with rs844644 and rs844648 between lSSc and controls. Compared to controls, the patients with dSSc had an increased frequency of the minor alleles at TNFSF4 SNPs rs1234314, rs2205960 and rs844648 and decreased frequency of the minor allele at rs844644. Comparison of patients with and without pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension did not reveal any differences in the frequency of the SNPs in the TNFSF4 gene region.\nUsing the SSc-associated autoantibodies to subset patients with SSc, a significant association was observed with rs1234214 and ACA-positive (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6) and ATA-positive patients with SSc (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.7) compared to controls. The minor allele at rs2205960 was more frequent in ATA-positive SSc compared to controls (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.9). Interestingly, only rs844648 was noted to be associated with ARA-positive SSc compared to controls (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8). No significant differences were noted in the SSc-associated autoantibody subsets of SSc compared to controls at rs844644.\nAdditional analyses were performed using logistic regression with gender added to the model (figure 2). The strongest associations were observed with rs2205960, where the minor allele was observed with increased frequency in lSSc and dSSc as well as the autoantibody subsets. The minor allele at rs844644 was protective in all groups except for the patients who were ARA positive. With regards to rs1234314, the associations remained in lSSc, ACA and ATA groups. However, the association of rs1234314 was no longer observed after controlling for gender in the logistic regression analyses. Lastly, with regards to rs844648, logistic regression confirmed the association with dSSc and ARA. Together these data suggest that different polymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene region are associated with susceptibility to the distinct autoantibody and skin subsets in SSc.\nCART analysis for SNP interaction in the TNFSF4 gene region\nTo identify the SNP(s) in TNFSF4 that play a more prominent role in SSc susceptibility, CART analysis was performed. Accordingly, the five TNFSF4 polymorphisms and gender were entered as variables in the CART model. CART analysis interactively segregates participants into two subgroups using the most powerful variable classifier for SSc.\nFigure 3 depicts female gender as the first split. In women, the \u2018TT/GT\u2019 genotype of the TNFSF4 variant (rs2205960) increased risk for SSc as compared to the \u2018GG\u2019 wild-type genotype (OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9) consistent with a dominant model.

Compared to controls, patients with SSc had a higher frequency of the minor allele at rs1234314 (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.4), rs2205960 (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.5) and rs844648 (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.3). The minor allele frequency at rs844648 was less common in patients with SSc compared to controls (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7 to 0.97). These data were confirmed using logistic regression analyses after controlling for gender (figure 2). No significant difference was observed between patients with SSc and controls for the rs844665 variant.\nAnalysis of the 5-SNP marker set (rs1234314, rs2205960, rs844644, rs844648, rs844665) in the TNFSF4 revealed 5 out of 28 specific 5-marker haplotypes that were associated with SSc (table 3). Four risk haplotypes were identified: C-G-A-A-C (p<10\u22124), G-G-C-G-C (p=0.0006), G-G-C-G-T (p<10\u22124) and G-T-C-G-C (p<10\u22124). Consistent with the individual SNP 3\u00d72 \u03c72 analysis, the C-G-A-G-C was found to be protective for the development of SSc (p<10\u22124). These data support the genetic associations of SNPs in TNFSF4 with SSc susceptibility observed in the case-control comparisons in table 2.\nTNFSF4 polymorphisms and association with subsets of SSc\nSSc is a clinically heterogeneous disease that is divided into two main clinical subsets based on the extent of cutaneous involvement: limited (lSSc) and diffuse (dSSc). Furthermore, the presence of SSc-associated autoantibodies such as ACA, ATA and ARA is associated with distinct clinical subsets characterised by extent of cutaneous involvement and pattern of organ involvement.

		" well as studies of gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interactions are necessary to better understand how the genetic associations lead to specific autoimmune diseases.\nOur study, despite its large size, is limited to the North American Caucasian population. Current efforts are underway to confirm these findings in other populations. However, we believe that the prior association of TNFSF4 with SLE and the emerging concepts of shared autoimmune genes provide some validation of our novel findings in SSc. Furthermore, the odds ratios that we observed in the current study are small, but statistically significant. It is well established that SSc and other autoimmune diseases are complex polygenic diseases and it will be important to investigate for interactions among these candidate genes in the future. Another important limitation to consider when interpreting the findings of the current study is that our data demonstrate an association of a region 5\u2032 of the TNFSF4 gene region with SSc susceptibility. These SNPs have been reported to be within the promoter region of TNFSF4 but their specific regulatory role is not known. Higher resolution genotyping or DNA sequencing of this region gene will help to identify the SNPs involved in SSc pathogenesis and also determine the variation in genetic structure of this gene in various populations.\nTo summarise, the current report identifies TNFSF4 as a susceptibility gene for the development of SSc. These data further our understanding of the complex immunopathogenesis of SSc and provide additional support for the emerging concept of shared genes in multiple autoimmune diseases.\nEthics approval: This study was conducted with the approval of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston Medical School IRB (Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects).\nContributors: All authors contributed to the following criteria for the manuscript authorship conception and design, or analysis and interpretation of data drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content and final approval of the version to be published.\nProvenance and peer review: Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\n\nSection Type: REF\nText: References\nReplication of putative candidate-gene associations with rheumatoid arthritis in >4,000 samples from North America and Sweden: association of susceptibility with PTPN22, CTLA4, and PADI4\nGenetics of type 1A diabetes\nGenetic susceptibility to SLE: new insights from fine mapping and genome-wide association studies\nA missense single-nucleotide polymorphism in a gene encoding a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) is associated with rheumatoid arthritis\nA functional polymorphism (1858C/T) in the PTPN22 gene is linked and associated with type I diabetes in multiplex families\nAssociation of a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism of PTPN22, encoding lymphoid protein phosphatase, with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus\nSTAT4 and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus\nThe STAT4 gene influences the genetic predisposition to systemic sclerosis phenotype\nPolymorphism at the TNF superfamily gene TNFSF4 confers susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus\nAssociation of BANK1 and TNFSF4 with systemic lupus erythematosus in Hong Kong Chinese\nGenetic variants of tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 4 (TNFSF4), and risk of incident atherothrombosis and venous thromboembolism\nGenetic variants of tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 4 (TNFSF4), and risk of incident atherothrombosis and venous thromboembolism\nGenetic variants of TNFSF4 and risk for carotid artery disease and stroke\nPositional identification of TNFSF4, encoding OX40 ligand, as a gene that influences atherosclerosis susceptibility\nSystemic sclerosis: hypothesis-driven treatment strategies\nSystemic sclerosis in 3 US ethnic groups: a comparison of clinical, sociodemographic, serologic, and immunogenetic determinants\nInterferon-inducible gene expression signature in peripheral blood cells of patients with severe lupus\nFunctional assay of type I interferon in systemic lupus erythematosus plasma and association with anti-RNA binding protein autoantibodies\nSignatures of differentially regulated interferon gene expression and vasculotrophism in the peripheral blood cells of systemic sclerosis patients\nThree functional variants of IFN regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) define risk and protective haplotypes for human lupus\nAssociation between the IRF5 rs2004640 functional polymorphism and systemic sclerosis: a new perspective for pulmonary fibrosis\nAssociation of the PTPN22 R620W polymorphism with anti-topoisomerase I- and anti-centromere antibody-positive systemic sclerosis\nThe -670G>A polymorphism in the FAS gene promoter region influences the susceptibility to systemic sclerosis\nA functional polymorphism in fas (CD95/APO-1) gene promoter associated with systemic lupus erythematosus\nFas promoter -670 polymorphism is associated with development of anti-RNP antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus\nThe establishment and utility of a population-based registry to understand the epidemiology of systemic sclerosis\nAutoantibodies to fibrillarin in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).

This interaction between the two TNFSF4 variants, rs2205960 and rs855648, was further tested and confirmed by an interaction model in logistic regression analysis (p=0.0004).\n\nSection Type: TABLE\nText: Clinical and serological characteristics of patients with systemic sclerosis\nCharacteristic\tValue\t \tControls:\t \tGender\t(N=698)*\t \t\u2003Female\t334 (50.8)\t \t\u2003Male\t323 (49.2)\t \tSystemic sclerosis:\t \tGender\t(N=1059)\t \t\u2003Female\t935 (88.3)\t \t\u2003Male\t124 (11.7)\t \tSkin involvement\t(N=1004)\t \t\u2003Limited systemic sclerosis\t611 (60.9)\t \t\u2003Diffuse systemic sclerosis\t393 (39.1)\t \tSSc-associated autoantibodies\t(N=1059)\t \t\u2003Anti-centromere\t300 (28.3)\t \t\u2003Anti-topoisomerase I\t174 (16.4)\t \t\u2003Anti-RNA polymerase III\t193 (18.2)\t \t\u2003Neither anti-centromere, anti-topoisomerase I, or anti-RNA polymerase III\t392 (37.1)\t \t\nValues are number (%).\nMissing gender information on 41 controls.\nDistribution of the tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4) SNP genotype in North American Caucasian patients with SSc and normal controls*\n\t\tMAF (%)\tAllelic \u03c72 p value and OR\t \tSNP (minor allele)\tPosition (bp)\tControls (N=698)\tSSc (N=1059)\tpU\tpFDR\tOR (95% CI)\t \trs1234314 (G)\t171444015\t41.3\t45.8\t0.01\t0.019\t1.20 (1.04 to 1.4)\t \trs2205960 (T)\t171458098\t21.2\t25.0\t0.01\t0.019\t1.24 (1.1 to 1.5)\t \trs844644 (A)\t171476118\t49.1\t44.7\t0.01\t0.019\t0.84 (0.7 to 0.97)\t \trs844648 (A)\t171490486\t41.4\t45.2\t0.03\t0.038\t1.16 (1.01 to 1.3)\t \trs844665 (T)\t171515580\t7.3\t8.3\t0.31\t0.31\t1.19 (0.9 to 1.5)\t \t\nControls are used as reference for all comparisons. bp, base pairs; MAF, minor allele frequency; pFDR, corrected p values using Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate method; pU, uncorrected \u03c72 p values; SSc, systemic sclerosis; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.\nHaplotype analysis of the 5-SNP marker set in the tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4) in Caucasian patients with SSc and controls\nHaplotype*\tControls (N=694)\tSSc (N=1050)\t\u03c72\tpU\tEffect direction\t \tOMNIBUS\tNA\tNA\t164.3\t<0.0001\t\t \tC-G-A-A-C\t0.6%\t4.9%\t52.6\t<0.0001\tRisk\t \tC-G-A-G-C\t43.4%\t35.1%\t25.3\t<0.0001\tProtective\t \tG-G-C-G-C\t0.4%\t1.7%\t12.1\t0.0006\tRisk\t \tG-G-C-G-T\t0.0%\t1.4%\t20.6\t<0.0001\tRisk\t \tG-T-C-G-C\t0.6%\t3.9%\t37.6\t<0.0001\tRisk\t \tOthers\u2020\t55.0%\t53.0%\t\t\tNeutral\t \t\nThe order of the SNPs is rs1234314\u2013rs2205960\u2013rs844644\u2013rs844648\u2013rs844665.\nIncludes 23 other haplotypes.\nNA, not applicable; pU, uncorrected \u03c72 p values; SSc, systemic sclerosis; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.\nDistribution of the tumour necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 4 gene (TNFSF4) SNP alleles in North American Caucasian patients with SSc and normal controls*\n",

Red test result denotes SSc susceptibility factors.\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: Discussion\nThe current report is the first demonstration of an association of polymorphisms in the TNFSF4 gene region with susceptibility to SSc in North American Caucasians. These associations were similar when comparing lSSc and dSSc with controls. We also identified particular SNPs in the TNFSF4 gene region that are associated with the SSc-associated autoantibody subsets of SSc. Lastly, the exploratory method of analysis, CART, demonstrated a potential interaction between the TNFSF4 SNPs rs2205960 and rs855648 among Caucasian women patients with SSc that was confirmed by logistic regression analysis.\nTNFSF4 encodes for the protein OX40 ligand (OX40L). OX40L is expressed on dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, T cells, natural killer (NK) cells as well as non-immune cells such as endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. It is the ligand for the OX40 which is expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, where it provides a costimulatory signal resulting in T cell proliferation, survival and cytokine production. Several studies have suggested that OX40\u2013OX40L interaction may preferentially promote T helper (Th)2 cytokines and may be a negative regulatory signal for interleukin (IL)17 production. More recently it has been suggested that OX40\u2013OX40L interactions inhibit the formation of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. In addition to T cell effects, OX40\u2013OX40L interactions also have been reported to be critical in differentiation of B cells and antibody production. Lastly, it has been reported that plasmacytoid dendritic cells may regulate T helper responses through a balance of OX40L expression and type I interferon expression such that OX40L alone induces a Th2 response and OX40L with type I interferon may have a Th1 inducing effect. Together these studies suggest an important role for OX40\u2013OX40L interactions in critical immunoregulatory checkpoints that are likely involved in the development of autoimmunity. Accordingly, OX40L transgenic mice on the C57/BL6 background develop organ specific inflammation and targeted strategies to block OX40\u2013OX40L interactions have prevented the development of diabetes in the non-obese diabetic mouse and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis. It is likely that these pathways and OX40L-dependent immune alterations are important in the development of SSc. Indeed serum levels of OX40 have been reported to be elevated in patients with SSc, suggesting that the OX40\u2013OX40L pathway may be involved in SSc. However, specifically how the OX40L polymorphisms lead to the development of SSc is unknown.\nThe current report adds TNFSF4 to the list of genes that are associated with SSc susceptibility which includes major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, PTPN22, AIF1, IRF5, STAT4 and FAS. Furthermore, given the association of TNFSF4 with SLE as well as SSc, it is likely that TNFSF4 is a gene that confers risk to multiple autoimmune diseases. Why individual patients will develop a specific autoimmune disease such as SLE, RA, or SSc remains unknown. Functional studies of the polymorphisms in these genes as well as studies of gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interactions are necessary to better understand how the genetic associations lead to specific autoimmune diseases.\nOur study, despite its large size, is limited to the North American Caucasian population. Current efforts are underway to confirm these findings in other populations. However, we believe that the prior association of TNFSF4 with SLE and the emerging concepts of shared autoimmune genes provide some validation of our novel findings in SSc. Furthermore, the odds ratios that we observed in",

		"plemental Figure 1). The most upregulated genes in skin were associated with B cell responses, including immunoglobulin genes such as IGLV3-27 (100-fold increased, adjusted P = 2.74 \u00d7 10\u20135), CD19 (33-fold, adjusted P = 6.48 \u00d7 10\u201324), and CD79a (32-fold, adjusted P = 3.58 \u00d7 10\u201322). Other genes included the antimicrobial gene DEFB4A (24-fold, adjusted P = 2.71 \u00d7 10\u201310); CXCL13, a B cell chemoattractant (16-fold, adjusted P = 1.25 \u00d7 10\u20138); and the neutrophil chemokine CXCL1 (2.8-fold, adjusted P = 2.91 \u00d7 10\u20132). In the WB, there were 332 DEGs, of which 230 were increased and 102 decreased (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).\nHS shows a complex inflammatory profile distinct from that of psoriasis or atopic dermatitis and enriched in genes involved in B cell function.\nTo address the major transcriptomic characteristics of HS, we compared it with RNA-Seq data from psoriasis (n = 28) and atopic dermatitis (AD) (n = 32) because the inflammatory responses in these 2 diseases are well characterized, and many of the drugs currently approved for these diseases are currently being repurposed for treatment of HS. Interestingly, genes dysregulated in lesional skin for all 3 diseases included the antimicrobial genes DEFB4A, SPRR2F, CD177, and TCN1. In terms of expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes in HS, we observed increased mRNA expression of IFNG (2.6-fold, adjusted P = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u20132), IL17A (8.6-fold, adjusted P = 6.7 \u00d7 10\u20137), IL17F (13.3-fold, adjusted P = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u20139), IL36A (9-fold, adjusted P = 1.2 \u00d7 10\u20134), and IL36G (2.4-fold, adjusted P = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u20132) compared with healthy controls, whereas IL13 and IL17C expression were overall decreased (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 2). Notably, the elevation of IL17A and IL17F expression in HS was comparable to the expression levels in psoriatic skin. With regard to the magnitude of the cytokine response in HS skin, we observed significant responses for stimulation of type II IFN (i.e., IFN-\u03b3; P = 5.9 \u00d7 10\u20135) and IL-36 (P = 9.3 \u00d7 10\u20134) in HS lesional skin, whereas the effect of Th2 response (i.e., IL-4), IL-17A, or TNF stimulation was absent in HS skin (Figure 1C). These data demonstrate lack of a dominant Th cytokine axis in HS, in contrast to AD (Th2) or psoriasis (Th17). To address the unique inflammatory responses in HS, we compared HS with either psoriasis or AD and found that the most prominent genes unique to HS included genes encoding immunoglobulins (Figure 1D). Using bulk RNA-Seq data from HS skin, we interrogated for cell type\u2013specific signatures. For HS skin the top 3 cell signatures were assigned to B cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201340), followed by various T cell populations, including Th2, and CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201312) (Figure 1E). In contrast, cell type signatures in blood included CD4+ naive cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201320), Th17 cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201315), and Th2 cells (P < 1 \u00d7 10\u201312) (Figure 1E).

		"Section Type: TITLE\nText: The OX40 Axis is Associated with Both Systemic and Local Involvement in Atopic Dermatitis\n\nSection Type: ABSTRACT\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease associated with asthma and allergic rhinitis, and is dominated by Th2 cells. The co-stimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD, as their interactions are crucial for the generation of TH2 memory cells. Using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and flow cytometry on blood samples from patients with AD and healthy volunteers, this study shows that the serum level of soluble (s) OX40 is decreased in patients with AD, and the expression of OX40 by activated skin-homing CD4+ T cells is increased. This study further shows, using immunofluorescence on skin biopsies, that OX40+ and OX40L+ cells are co-located within the dermis, indicating local activity of OX40/OX40L. Serum levels of sOX40 were associated with atopic diseases and, together, these results support that the OX40 system is important for chronic inflammation in AD skin.\n\nSection Type: INTRO\nText: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 20% of children and may persist into adulthood. The symptoms are eczema, intense pruritus, and dry skin, caused by a profound skin inflammation and epidermal barrier dysfunction. Up to 80% of patients with AD have elevated levels of IgE. Furthermore, development of memory T cells is believed to be central for chronicity in AD.\nOX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are both members of the tumour necrosis factor superfamily and are important regulators of the immune response. The OX40 system is required for generating a long-term memory response and optimal T-cell activation. The OX40-OX40L axis is considered to be involved in the development of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including allergic asthma.\nT-cell expression of OX40 and antigen-presenting cells (APC) expression of OX40L appear within 2\u20133 days after antigen-activation. The signal through OX40 enhances T-cell clonal expansion and, especially, survival of TH2 cells. Apart from APC, OX40L is also expressed by mast cells. Both OX40 and OX40L also exist in soluble forms. Soluble OX40 (sOX40) has an anti-inflammatory effect when binding to the membrane-bound form of OX40L. sOX40 is able to mimic regulatory T-cell function, inhibit mast cell degranulation and thereby reduce the inflammatory response.\nSIGNIFICANCE\nAtopic dermatitis is a chronic, or chronically relapsing, inflammatory skin disease dominated by Th2 cells. The costimulatory T-cell receptor OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are crucial for the generation of Th2 memory cells, and may thus play a central role in the pathogenesis and chronicity of atopic dermatitis. This study shows that OX40 expression is increased on skin-homing T cells in patients with atopic dermatitis, and that OX40 and OX40L cells are colocalized in the skin. These findings indicate that the OX40 system could play a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction of atopic dermatitis in the skin.\nNot only are mast cells implicated in the immediate hypersensitivity reactions, but also in the production of TH2 driving cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-25, and hence central mediators of AD pathogenesis.\nFurthermore, IgE-activated mast cells have been shown to interact with T cells through expression of OX40L, suggesting a sophisticated interplay between these immune cells mediated by IgE and OX40L.\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the OX40/ OX40L axis in AD, including the OX40 expressing cells and the correlation between serum levels and disease-specific markers.\n\nSection Type: METHODS\nText: MATERIALS AND METHODS\nPatient samples\nPatients with AD were diagnosed using the Hanifin & Rajka criteria. None of the patients were receiving systemic immune suppressive therapy at the time of sample collection. All patients were assessed by use of the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis index (SCORAD) and measurement of total IgE serum level.\nSerum samples from 67 adults (age 30; range 24\u201342 years), and 60 children with AD (age 8; 3\u201314 years) were collected at the Department of Dermatology, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Campus Kiel, Germany. Clinical parameters were acquired at the time of blood collection: SCORAD, total serum IgE and the presence of asthma and/or rhinitis (Table I). Serum samples were also obtained from 31 healthy controls (HC) (age 39; 28\u201351 years) matched for age and sex with the adult AD group. The controls had no history of AD or other systemic inflammatory diseases. All adult patients with AD and HC gave their written informed consent. The parents provided written consent on behalf of their children with AD. For ethical reasons serum samples from healthy children were not included.\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma were collected from 11 adult patients with AD (age 29; 21\u201343 years) and 10 age- and sex-matched HC (age 27; 24\u201333 years) with no atopic diseases or systemic inflammatory diseases (Table I). The PBMCs were isolated",
		" this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness when used as treatment for AD.\nTogether, these findings indicate a close correlation between the OX40 system and atopic diseases.\nIn conclusion, OX40 expression is increased on skinhoming T cells and, together with our finding that OX40 and OX40L are co-localized in the skin, the OX40-OX40L system may play an important role in the recruitment to and activation of these cells in the skin. This finding is supported by the association of disease activity and atopic co-morbidities in atopic dermatitis, and we hypothesize that the OX40 system plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory reaction in the skin. It is therefore of interest to follow the development of AD treatments targeting the OX40 system.\n The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare. \n\nSection Type: REF\nText: REFERENCES\nAtopic dermatitis\nNew insights into atopic dermatitis\nThe role of TNF superfamily members in T-cell function and diseases\nOX40 promotes Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression and is essential for long-term survival of CD4 T cells\nThe OX40 costimulatory receptor determines the development of CD4 memory by regulating primary clonal expansion\nOX40-OX40 ligand interaction in T-cell-mediated immunity and immunopathology\nSoluble OX40L is associated with presence of autoantibodies in early rheumatoid arthritis\nSOX40L: an important inflammatory mediator in adult bronchial asthma\nInterruption of the OX40-OX40 ligand pathway in LDL receptor-deficient mice causes regression of atherosclerosis\nControl of immunity by the TNFR-related molecule OX40 (CD134)\nCritical role for OX40 ligand in the development of pathogenic Th2 cells in a murine model of asthma\nT cell proliferation by direct cross-talk between OX40 ligand on human mast cells and OX40 on human T cells: comparison of gene expression profiles between human tonsillar and lung-cultured mast cells\nTechnical advance: soluble OX40 molecule mimics regulatory T cell modulatory activity on FcepsilonRI-dependent mast cell degranulation\nMast cells produce interleukin-25 upon Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation\nMast cells enhance T cell activation: importance of mast cell costimulatory molecules and secreted TNF\nDiagnostic features of atopic dermatitis\nA simple set of validation steps identifies and removes false results in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay caused by anti-animal IgG antibodies in plasma from arthritis patients\nSerum OX40 ligand levels in asthmatic children: a potential biomarker of severity and persistence\nOX40 ligand: a potential costimulatory molecule in atopic asthma\nThe upregulated expression of OX40/OX40L and their promotion of T cells proliferation in the murine model of asthma\nCrucial role of OX40/OX40L signaling in a murine model of asthma\nGBR 830, an anti-OX40, improves skin gene signatures and clinical scores in patients with atopic dermatitis\n",
		"scRNA-Seq) was performed on cells isolated from 9 excisional samples from patients with severe HS. We collected 30,636 cells with a median 1974 genes and a median 7342 transcripts. We did unsupervised clustering analysis and grouped the cells into 22 clusters (Figure 2A), which were further annotated as 10 cell types including keratinocytes, melanocytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, B cells, plasma cells, T cells, myeloid cells, and mast cells (Figure 2A). Three representative signature genes for each cell type are shown in the heatmap (Figure 2B). To learn cell-cell communication between the cell types, we performed CellPhoneDB ligand-receptor analysis and plotted the top ranked 200 pairs in a Circos plot (Figure 2C). We also show the connection linked from or to B cells and plasma cells (Figure 3, A and B). The ligand-receptor analysis demonstrated extensive interactions between all the major cell subsets in HS, including interactions of B cells and plasma cells with stromal tissue cells and other immune cell components. Notable interactions include members of the Notch signaling pathway with endothelial and keratinocyte cell populations, keratinocyte-derived CCL20 with T cells, and interaction of IFN-\u03b3 with various stromal cell clusters (Supplemental Table 4). We identified both IL17A- and IFNG-expressing T cells in HS skin (Supplemental Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure 5). Notably, IL18, a promoter of IFN-\u03b3 responses, was primarily derived from keratinocytes. We also performed enrichment analysis on the signature genes for each cell type, demonstrating enrichment of complement activation (P = 5.0 \u00d7 10\u201311), positive regulation of B cell activation (P = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u201310), and antibacterial humoral response (1.6 \u00d7 10\u20135) in the plasma cell population; B cell receptor signaling pathway (P = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u20138) and IFN-\u03b3 mediated signaling pathway (P = 0.03) in B cells; inflammatory response (P = 6.2 \u00d7 10\u201315) and neutrophil chemotaxis (P = 3.9 \u00d7 10\u20137) in the myeloid cell population; and T cell receptor signaling pathway (P = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u201314), T cell costimulation (P = 7.0 \u00d7 10\u201311), and regulation of TNF-mediated signaling (P = 8.4 \u00d7 10\u20136) in the T cell compartment (Figure 2D).\nKeratinocytes show heightened type II IFN and IL-36 responses.\nTo study the cytokine response in the largest population in our scRNA-Seq data, we performed subclustering on the keratinocytes and obtained 13 subclusters (Figure 4A). The top marker genes for each subcluster are shown in Figure 4B. We used a broad range of cytokine response signatures, as previously described by our group, to interrogate each keratinocyte subcluster for a particular inflammatory signature (Supplemental Table 5). A module score for each cytokine was calculated for each cell based on the expression of the signature genes induced by the cytokine. Then the module scores for each subcluster were plotted in Figure 4C. This demonstrates high inflammatory burden in keratinocytes in subcluster 7, particularly for IL-17 responses (adjusted P < 1 \u00d7 10\u2013250), IL-36 responses (adjusted P = 6.4 \u00d7 10\u201377), and TNF responses (adjusted P = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u20139). This cluster was characterized by high expression of antimicrobial genes, such as DEFB4A, S100A7A, and IL36G. In contrast, subclusters 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8 showed enrichment for both type I and type II IFN responses (adjusted P < 1 \u00d7 10\u2013250), with IFN-\u03b3 additionally showing an enriched response in subcluster 7 (adjusted P < 1 \u00d7 10\u2013250). The distribution of each cytokine response can also be observed by plotting the module scores on the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (Figure 5A). To address the specificity of each signal, we focused on the 4 main responses: IFN-\u03b3, TNF, IL-17A, and IL-36. Of these, unique cytokine responses were most abundant for IFN-\u03b3, followed by IL-36 and TNF (red lines) (Figure 5B), whereas nonspecific and overlapping responses were observed for IL-17A and to a lesser extent for the other cytokine responses (gray lines, Figure 5B). These data demonstrate that only a proportion of keratinocytes are responding to inflammatory stimuli in HS and that these responses are dominated by IFN-\u03b3, followed by IL-36G and TNF, with lesser contribution by IL-17A.\nB cells and plasma cells predominate in HS skin lesions.\nTo determine whether the transcriptomic signatures align with the cellular infiltrates in HS, we used CyTOF imaging to identify and quantify infiltrating leukocytes. HS skin had a marked increase in leukocyte infiltration compared with normal skin (Figure 6A). When visualized using the dimensional reduction tool t-SNE, there was complete separation between the leukocyte clustering in HS skin compared with normal skin, with 12 distinct clusters being observed in HS and 2 clusters in normal (Figure 6B). Markers characterizing each cluster are shown (Figure",

In AD skin, in particular, OX40-positive staining was present on the surface of OX40L-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). That these were indeed OX40L-expressing mast cells were confirmed by positive tryptase staining (Fig. 3B).\n\nSection Type: FIG\nText: Decreased serum levels of sOX40, but not sOX40L, in atopic dermatitis (AD).

Original magnification \u00d740.\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: DISCUSSION\nThe results of this study show that children and adults with AD have reduced serum levels of sOX40 compared with adult HC. Although the patients in the study cohort were included based on their presentation of AD, some patients also had allergic rhinitis and asthma. This subsequently made it possible to examine the association of serum levels of sOX40 and sOX40L and atopic comorbidities in patients with AD.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated elevated sOX40L levels in patients with active allergic asthma. This was further supported by Farres et al., who showed that increased expression of OX40L on B cells is associated with the level of total IgE in allergic asthma patients. These findings are in line with murine asthma models, in which OX40L is highly expressed by a variety of cells within the lung during an induced allergic reaction. Although, in general, decreased serum levels were observed in AD, adults with concomitant asthma had the highest levels of serum sOX40. As with all members of the TNF-super family, sOX40 can bind to its ligand expressed by different cell types. This may explain the decrease in serum levels of sOX40. However, in our experiments we observed similar levels of sOX40L in healthy volunteers and patients with AD and, thus, circulating sOX40L is not an appropriate marker of disease activity in AD.\nMore interestingly, focusing on circulating skin-homing CD4+ T cells from patients with AD we observed an increase in expression of OX40. As skin-homing T cells are able to upregulate OX40 expression, an increased number of pathogenic T cells can migrate to the inflammatory site of the skin and thereby enhance local inflammation.\nIn addition, this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness",

Serum levels of soluble (s)OX40 and sOX40L were measured in patients with AD (adults n = 67 and children n = 60) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 31) matched for age and sex with AD adults, by enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). (a) In adult patients with AD, serum levels of sOX40 were significantly decreased compared with HC. In children with AD, serum level of sOX40 showed similar levels as in adults with AD. (b) Serum levels of soluble OX40L showed no significant differences between the patients with AD and HC. Data are analysed by Mann-Whitney U test.

(a) Skin biopsies from involved (n = 5) and uninvolved skin (n = 5) from patients with AD were examined for the presence of OX40 (red) and OX40L (green) and compared with healthy controls (n = 5). Nuclear staining was carried out by DAPI (blue). OX40- and OX40L-positive cells were present in involved and uninvolved AD skin.

Original magnification \u00d740.\n\nSection Type: DISCUSS\nText: DISCUSSION\nThe results of this study show that children and adults with AD have reduced serum levels of sOX40 compared with adult HC. Although the patients in the study cohort were included based on their presentation of AD, some patients also had allergic rhinitis and asthma. This subsequently made it possible to examine the association of serum levels of sOX40 and sOX40L and atopic comorbidities in patients with AD.\nPrevious studies have demonstrated elevated sOX40L levels in patients with active allergic asthma. This was further supported by Farres et al., who showed that increased expression of OX40L on B cells is associated with the level of total IgE in allergic asthma patients. These findings are in line with murine asthma models, in which OX40L is highly expressed by a variety of cells within the lung during an induced allergic reaction. Although, in general, decreased serum levels were observed in AD, adults with concomitant asthma had the highest levels of serum sOX40. As with all members of the TNF-super family, sOX40 can bind to its ligand expressed by different cell types. This may explain the decrease in serum levels of sOX40. However, in our experiments we observed similar levels of sOX40L in healthy volunteers and patients with AD and, thus, circulating sOX40L is not an appropriate marker of disease activity in AD.\nMore interestingly, focusing on circulating skin-homing CD4+ T cells from patients with AD we observed an increase in expression of OX40. As skin-homing T cells are able to upregulate OX40 expression, an increased number of pathogenic T cells can migrate to the inflammatory site of the skin and thereby enhance local inflammation.\nIn addition, this study was able to localize OX40-expressing cells to the skin of patients with AD. These cells were co-localized with mast cells, suggesting an interplay between mast cells and activated T cells through OX40-OX40L in the skin of patients with AD, and this may provide the background for part of the mechanism by which anti-OX40 therapy exerts its effect on both Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score, biomarkers and skin thickness",
		" pg/ml) compared with HC (15.6; 3.7\u201332.3 pg/ ml) (p < 0.0001). In children with AD, sOX40 levels were comparable with adult AD levels (9.7; 2.0\u201324.6 pg/ml) (Fig. 1A). Regarding sOX40L, no significant differences were observed between the groups (Fig. 1B).\nSerum levels of sOX40 is associated with atopic comorbidities and in children with disease activity\nSignificantly different levels of serum sOX40 were observed between the groups; therefore we examined the association between the individual serum sOX40 level, the SCORAD index, and other markers related to atopic disease activity. In the group of adults with AD, the patients with asthma had significant higher sOX40 serum levels (10.0; range 4.0\u201312.8 pg/ml), compared with those without asthma (7.0; 4.6\u201310.2 pg/ml) (p < 0.01). In children, sOX40 correlated with SCORAD (\u03c1 = 0.404, p < 0.01) (Table II). Soluble OX40L showed no association with disease activity measurements, either in children or in adults.\nOX40 and OX40L are highly expressed by skin-homing T cells and monocytes in atopic dermatitis\nConsidering the reduced sOX40 serum levels in patients with AD, we investigated the surface expression of OX40 and its ligand on PBMCs from adult patients with AD. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs from adult patients with AD (n = 11) and HC (n = 10) revealed that OX40 was mainly expressed by skin-homing memory-prone CLA+ T cells, in both AD patients and HC (Fig. 2A and B).\nIn adult patients with AD, 8.9% (6.8\u201314.2%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells expressed OX40 followed by 4.6% (3.4\u20136.6%) of the CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells. OX40 expression in AD patients was less pronounced on CD8+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells (0.5%; 0.0\u20132.6%) and CD8+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells (0.7%; 0.4\u20131.3%)). No differences were observed compared with HC (Fig. 2A).\nA similar pattern emerged when the results were evaluated using median fluorescence intensity (MFI), although with important differences: CD4+CD45RO+CLA+ T cells from patients with AD expressed the highest amount of OX40 per cell (MFI 287 (244\u2013317)), and revealed a significantly higher level than HC (MFI 235; range 215\u2013275) (p < 0.05). CD4+CD45RO+CLA\u2212 T cells expressed a lower amount of OX40 (MFI 246; range 238\u2013299), but also significantly higher than HC (MFI 214 (206\u2013231)) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B). A similar pattern was observed for the CD8+ T cells, but to a lesser degree than by CD4+ T cells. In general, monocytes expressed high levels of OX40L both in percentage (64.1%; range 8.1\u201392.1%) and MFI (1964; range 244\u20133649) (Fig. 2C and D), but no differences were observed between AD and HC (all p > 0.05).\nCellular expression of OX40 in patients with atopic dermatitis inversely correlates with SCORAD\nTo further evaluate OX40 in AD, the relative cell populations were correlated with disease activity (SCORAD) and serum IgE. The percentage of CD4+CD45RO+OX40+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells correlated inversely with disease activity measured by SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.809, p < 0.01) and CLA\u2212 (\u03c1 = \u22120.782, p < 0.01)). Similarly, the MFI also correlated with SCORAD (CLA+ (\u03c1 = \u22120.709, p < 0.1) and CLA- (\u03c1 = \u22120.674, p < 0.05)), but not with serum IgE levels. No correlations with disease activity and serum IgE for OX40 expressed by CD8+CD45RO+ CLA+/\u2212 T cells or OX40L expressed by monocytes were observed. Individual plasma levels of sOX40 and sOX40L did not correlate with surface expression of OX40 and OX40L (data not shown).\nOX40 and OX40L are co-localized in atopic dermatitis\nTo confirm the involvement of OX40-OX40L interactions directly in the skin, immunofluorescence staining was carried out on involved and uninvolved skin biopsies from adult patients with AD and from HC. OX40- and OX40L-expressing cells were identified in both involved and uninvolved tissue (not shown) and found to be co-localized within the dermis (Fig. 3A). In AD skin, in particular, OX40-positive staining was present on the surface of OX40L-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). That these were indeed OX40L-expressing mast cells were confirmed by positive tryptase staining (Fig. ",
