The estimated prevalence of HS is ~1% in most studied countries. Typically starting in early adulthood, cutaneous inflamed nodules, abscesses and pus-discharging tunnels develop in axillary, inguinal, gluteal and perianal body sites. The comorbidities of HS include metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, which contribute to reduced life expectancy. A genetic predisposition, smoking, obesity and hormonal factors are established aetiological factors for HS. Cutaneous changes seem to start around hair follicles and involve activation of cells of the innate and adaptive immune systems, with pivotal roles for pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17. The unrestricted and chronic immune response eventually leads to severe pain, pus discharge, irreversible tissue destruction and scar development. HS has profound negative effects on patients' quality of life, which often culminate in social withdrawal, unemployment, depression and suicidal thoughts. The therapeutic options for HS comprise antibiotic treatment, neutralization of tumour necrosis factor and surgical intervention together with lifestyle modification. Nevertheless, there is an enormous need for awareness of HS, understanding of its pathogenesis and novel treatments.", "Year": 2020, "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32165620/", "Qualifers": [], "citedby": 340, "last_author": "Kerstin Wolk", "authors": ["Robert Sabat", "Gregor B E Jemec", "\u0141ukasz Matusiak", "Alexa B Kimball", "Errol Prens", "Kerstin Wolk"], "journal_name": "Nature reviews.

However, the long-term effectiveness of this TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor in HS patients has shown to be highly variable. This review aims to review the evidence for emerging therapies that target the main pro-inflammatory cytokines in HS pathogenesis. A review of the literature was conducted, using the PubMed and Google Scholar repositories, as well as Clinicaltrials.gov. Presently, the most promising biologics in phase III trials are anti-IL-17 antibodies, secukinumab, and bimekizumab. Furthermore, an anti-IL-1 biologic, bermekimab, is currently in phase II trials, and shows encouraging results. Overall, the clinical efficacies of all new targeted therapies published up to this point are limited. More studies need to be performed to clarify the precise molecular pathology, and assess the efficacy of biological therapies for HS.", "Year": 2022, "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35409118/", "Qualifers": ["pathology"], "citedby": 39, "last_author": "Zrinka Bukvi\u0107 Mokos", "authors": ["Adela Markota \u010cagalj", "Branka Marinovi\u0107", "Zrinka Bukvi\u0107 Mokos"], "journal_name": "International journal of molecular sciences", "journal_issn": "14220067", "journal_rank": 3393, "recency_score": 1.0, "citedby_score": 0.11, "journal_rank_score": 0.93, "overall_score": 0.68, "hindex": 0, "hindex_score": 0.0}, {"PMID": "32054085", "Title": "The Role of the Cutaneous Microbiome in Hidradenitis Suppurativa-Light at the End of the Microbiological Tunnel.", "Abstract": "The development of next generation sequencing, coupled with advances in bio-informatics, has provided new insights into the role of the cutaneous microbiome in the pathophysiology of a range of inflammatory skin diseases.

Surgical resections related to skin disease are frequent in this region and their extension often requires soft tissue transfer for coverage. In this setting, locoregional pedicled flaps are usually preferred. The nearby tissues offer pliable but still resistant skin, which satisfy the \"like-with-like\" reconstructive principle. Over the years different procedures have been described for this purpose. Among them, a valuable and often underestimated technique is the circumflex scapular artery perforator flap (CSAP). This technique might be particularly suitable for thin but relatively large defects. Its main advantages are a low donor site morbidity, a very reliable anatomy, and a perforator pedicle able supply a large skin paddle. In the present work, we report the use of a pedicled vertical CSAP flap passed through the axillary canal in order to cover a 9\u2009cm\u2009\u00d7\u20097\u2009cm axillary defect after surgical excision of hidradenitis suppurativa resistant to conservative treatment. The perforator-based pedicled presented two branches, which allowed us to harvest safely a large skin paddle, which limited its range of motion. For this reason, we opted for a passage through the axillary canal for the flap inset. The postoperative course was uneventful and full shoulder range of motion was obtained at 3\u2009months follow-up. Despite most of the descriptions of this flap available so far showed its employment for limb's reconstructions, we believe that it is a very useful tool also for locoregional coverage.

The main focus of our systematic review was on HS manifestation, exacerbation, sex hormones, antiandrogen therapy, thyroid function, polycystic ovary syndrome, insulin resistance, and adipokines. In HS, there appears to be a dysregulated adipokine release that is shifted towards pro-inflammatory adipokines. Insulin resistance is significantly more common in HS than in healthy patients regardless of BMI, age, and gender. Insulin resistance in HS patients leads to further cardiovascular disease.

Hormones are thought to play an important role in HS pathophysiology, but there is a lack of an updated review on hormonal treatments in HS.&nbsp; Objective: Perform a systematic review of the literature on hormonal treatments in patients with HS.&nbsp; Methods: In April 2022, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles on hormonal treatments in HS. Non-English, duplicate, and irrelevant results were excluded. Data extraction was performed by two reviewers.&nbsp; Results: From 1952 to 2022, 30 articles (634 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Anti-androgen treatments discussed include finasteride (n=8), spironolactone (n=7), cyproterone acetate (CPA) (n=5), flutamide (n=1), leuprolide (n=1), and buserelin acetate (n=1). Metabolic treatments reported include metformin (n=8) and liraglutide (n=2). Three articles on hormonal contraceptives and 2 articles on testosterone were included. Of the articles which reported response rates, 62.8% (27/43) of patients improved with finasteride, 53.3% (32/60) with CPA mono/combination therapy, 50.5% (51/101) with spironolactone, and 46.0% (74/161) with metformin.

Thus, ultrasonography has helped prove the follicular link of this disease and has ruled out the primary involvement of the apocrine glands, which, in the old days, was supposedly the cause of the disease. Importantly, ultrasound can detect subclinical anatomical information in HS that cannot be deducted from the clinical examination. Moreover, high-frequency (\u226515 MHz) and ultra-high-frequency (\u226550 MHz) ultrasound present a much higher axial spatial resolution compared to magnetic resonance imaging. Ultrasound allows us to detect better subclinical cutaneous anatomical abnormalities and, therefore, arrive earlier and more accurately at diagnosis and staging. Ultrasonographic diagnostic criteria can discriminate HS from other clinical simulators, which is also critical in diagnosing mild and moderate stages and is relevant for the severe stages. This imaging technique supports the severity (mSOS-HS) and activity (US-HSA) scorings more accurately, which can help assess the actual stage of the disease. This is important to decide the type of treatment and to perform a more objective follow-up of the patients. Magnetic resonance imaging has been reported as helpful in diagnosing deep perianal tunnels; however, it presents a lower axial spatial resolution compared with high and ultra-high frequency ultrasound.

HS has an estimated global prevalence of 0.00033-4.1% (but most likely 0.7-1.2% in the European-US population). Patients still experience a significant diagnostic delay, up to several years. In the absence of pathognomonic tests, the diagnosis of HS is made from clinical observation and the disease narrative. Phenotypic variation renders diagnosis and severity assessment difficult. Ultrasound imaging is an emerging assessment tool for deep-seated lesions. The Hurley Staging System is still widely used in severity rating. Follicular hyperkeratosis and dilatation, follicular rupture and chronic inflammation with architectural tissue changes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HS. HS has been associated with metabolic syndrome and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus type II, polycystic ovarian syndrome, depression, suicide and substance use disorders. It has been linked to other immune-mediated diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and spondyloarthropathy. Pain, pruritus, malodour, low self-esteem, sleep and sexual dysfunctions, and poor mental health are chronic symptoms or consequences of uncontrolled disease. HS is an under-diagnosed and under-treated disease with a profound negative impact on patients' quality of life. In the light of its associated comorbidities, an interdisciplinary management approach may be needed to ensure the best outcomes.", "Year": 2021, "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32460374/", "Qualifers": ["diagnosis", "epidemiology"], "citedby": 216, "last_author": "G B Jemec", "authors": ["T V Nguyen", "G Damiani", "L A V Orenstein", "I Hamzavi", "G B Jemec"], "journal_name": "Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV", "journal_issn": "14683083", "journal_rank": 50000, "recency_score": 1.0, "citedby_score": 0.64, "journal_rank_score": 0.0, "overall_score": 0.55, "hindex": 0, "hindex_score": 0.0}, {"PMID": "36812153", "Title": "Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Surgery, Lasers, and Emerging Techniques.", "Abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by painful nodules, abscesses and tunnels in skin folds.

Patients develop inflamed nodules and abscesses and, at later stages of disease, epithelialized tunnels and scars in skinfolds of axillary, inguinal, gluteal and perianal areas. Quality of life is affected due to severe pain, purulent secretion, restricted mobility and systemic involvement. Genetics and lifestyle factors including smoking and obesity contribute to the development of HS. These factors lead to microbiome alteration, subclinical inflammation around the terminal hair follicles, and infundibular hyperkeratosis, resulting in plugging and rupture of the follicles. Cell-damage-associated molecules and propagating bacteria trigger inflammation and lead to massive immune cell infiltration that clinically manifests as inflamed nodules and abscesses. The immune system plays a key role also in the progression and chronification of skin alterations. Innate proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1), mediators of activated T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells (e.g. interleukin-17 and interferon-\u03b3), and effector mechanisms of neutrophilic granulocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are involved. Simultaneously, skin lesions contain anti-inflammatory mediators (e.g. interleukin-10) and show limited activity of Th22 and regulatory T cells. The inflammatory vicious circle finally results in pain, purulence, tissue destruction and scarring. Chronic inflammation in patients with HS is also frequently detected in organs other than the skin, as indicated by their comorbidities.

The major factors influencing patients' well-being are disease severity, the number of flares or affected skin areas, and the lesion location. The mean Dermatology Life Quality Index scores of 8\u00b73-12\u00b77 points obtained among patients with HS are typical for severe dermatoses, which have a large impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). HS not only affects skin-related QoL issues, but also has a profound impact on general QoL measures - it causes substantial deterioration of both physical and mental health. Considering the impaired QoL due to HS and HS-associated, nonpsychiatric comorbidities, it is not surprising that patients with HS experience psychological disturbances. In both observational and registry studies, depression and anxiety were significantly related to HS. The prevalences were estimated as 1\u00b76-42\u00b79% and 0\u00b78-3\u00b79%, respectively.

The aim of this study is to summarize the evidence regarding the impact of HS signs and symptoms on QoL to serve as a basis for future research and help clinicians to consider them in the daily care of HS patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA Guidelines. The following search algorithm was used: (hidradenitis or \"acne inversa\") and (pain or itch or odour or malodour or suppuration or oozing or drainage) and (\"quality of life\"). The literature search identified 836 references, 17 of them met the eligible criteria and were included for analysis, representing 4929 HS patients.

Twenty-five articles were included. Meta-analysis of nine case-control studies across Asia, Europe, and the United States showed that HS patients are four times more likely to be obese compared to the general population; random effects pooled odds ratio 4.022 (2.667-6.065), P\u00a0<\u00a00.001. Five articles assessed weight-loss interventions and revealed mixed findings. The remaining articles included three association studies on micronutrient levels, eight dietary intervention studies, and one article analyzing both micronutrient association and dietary intervention. Included articles in this systematic review reveal that low serum zinc and vitamin D levels are associated with increased lesion count in HS. Supplementation of zinc, vitamin D, vitamin B12, or exclusion of dairy or brewer's yeast can be effective in partial or complete lesion resolution. Reviewed data show that weight loss from bariatric surgery may lead to HS improvement but often results in more severe malnutrition that worsens or even leads to new onset HS post bariatric surgery. Future reporting is needed to conclusively determine the role of diet in HS.", "Year": 2020, "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Meta-Analysis", "Systematic Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31651051/", "Qualifers": [], "citedby": 27, "last_author": "Natasha A Mesinkovska", "authors": ["Franchesca Choi", "Larisa Lehmer", "Chloe Ekelem", "Natasha A Mesinkovska"], "journal_name": "International journal of dermatology", "journal_issn": "13654632", "journal_rank": 50000, "recency_score": 1.0, "citedby_score": 0.08, "journal_rank_score": 0.0, "overall_score": 0.36, "hindex": 0, "hindex_score": 0.0}, {"PMID": "31905036", "Title": "Skin immunity and its dysregulation in atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa and vitiligo.", "Abstract": "While the epidermis is the frontline defense against infections and indeed, it is a peripheral lymphoid organ, the same immunological mechanisms may initiate and sustain pathological conditions.

The clinical databases used included Medline and Embase. All types of epidemiological articles were included; reviews, guidelines, protocols, conference abstracts and case report articles were excluded. Eleven studies were included for review, representing 42\u00a0729 patients with HS. The most common study design was cross-sectional with or without comparison group(s), conducted in an outpatient setting or through surveys. Prevalence of sexual dysfunction ranged between 51-62%, and in the case of erectile dysfunction, a specific kind of sexual dysfunction affecting penile erection, it ranged from between 52% and 60% of patients studied using validated questionnaires. Potential risk factors for sexual dysfunction among men and women were identified, mainly related to disease activity, symptoms and partners. Mood disorders like depression and anxiety appear to be associated with sexual dysfunction. Women were more affected by sexual distress. HS patients with sexual dysfunction had a decreased overall quality of life. With respect to treatment, surgery did not improve sexual function and there is no scientific evidence regarding medical treatments. Patients stated that they would like to treat their sexual problems with healthcare professionals. In conclusion, sexual and erectile dysfunction are common in HS patients, and negatively affect their quality of life.

This systematic review (PROSPERO registry number: CRD42020179141) aimed at mapping the risk factors and the associated burden over time in patients with psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (AD) and hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Three electronic databases were searched (date of the last search: December 2019). Studies with a longitudinal study design that assessed the association between a risk factor and the associated burden over time in patients with psoriasis, AD and HS were included. Quality assessment of the included studies was done using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklists. In total, 40 publications reflecting 25 different studies were included: nine studies addressed patients with psoriasis, 13 patients with AD, two studies included patients with HS and one study enrolled patients with psoriasis and AD, respectively. Twenty-two potential risk factors with underlying evidence were found in this review. These risk factors include mainly sociodemographic (such as age or gender) and clinical (such as disease severity or comorbidities) variables. Disease severity and comorbidities were the most often studied risk factors, while only a few studies evaluated psychosocial risk factors over time. Patients with chronic skin diseases are at high risk to develop a life-long negative impact from the disease. However, there is a lack of data that evaluates the psychosocial burden and its influence on the patients' life course over time. The risk factors found in this review help to identify patients at risk, to treat them adequately and, ultimately, to prevent CLCI.

It is characterized by recurrent painful nodules and abscesses that potentially rupture, resulting in sinus tract formation, fistulas, and scarring. HS tends to be found in the intertriginous areas (i.e., the axillary, inguinal, and perianal areas of the body). HS may be uncommon for radiologists because its diagnosis is usually based on clinical assessment. However, diagnosis based solely on clinical manifestations can underestimate the severity of HS. Ultrasonography and MRI play a critical adjunct role in determining the severity and extent of the disease and greatly aid its management. Given that MRI is an effective imaging tool, its role in the analysis of severe and anogenital HS lesions merits considerable attention. Unfortunately, anoperineal HS imposes diagnostic dilemmas. It has multiple symptoms and presentations and often mimics other diseases in the intertriginous areas. Therefore, a thorough understanding of HS is essential to avoid delayed diagnoses.

Itch is also a common but overlooked concern in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). Currently, the mechanisms underlying itch in HS remain unclear. To gain a better understanding, we reviewed the literature on pruritus in HS and other itch-predominant disorders, AD, and psoriasis. In HS, psoriasis, and AD, we found that itch often co-localized with pain and occurred more frequently at night. Furthermore, itch was found to negatively affect sleep and increase the risk for comorbid psychiatric disorders in HS, psoriasis, and AD. However, HS-, psoriasis-, and AD-related itch differ in temporality. Itch in AD is often described as chronic, while itch in HS and psoriasis is often described as episodic. HS-associated itch is likely multifactorial, and several mechanisms have been proposed including peripheral sensitization, central sensitization, and neuroinflammation. Prior studies in HS highlight enhanced IgE production and a dense infiltration of mast cells, along with a variety of cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, alterations in the skin microbiome may contribute to itch in HS. To date, few therapies have been studied to treat itch in HS. Given the efficacy of several biologics and small molecules in treating itch in AD and psoriasis, similar agents may be explored in future HS studies. Alternative therapies to target neurological and psychiatric contributions to itch may include anticonvulsants, cannabinoids, and nonpharmacological treatments.

With a prevalence of 1-4%, HS is not an uncommon disease. Several risk factors have been linked with the development of HS, such as genetic predisposition, smoking, and obesity, leading to the hypothesis that HS develops as a result of environmental triggers in a genetically susceptible individual. Smoking has been recognized as one of the environmental factors with the most impact on HS. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and holistic view on how smoking habits affect the incidence, severity, treatment, and pathophysiology of HS. A growing body of published literature has reported the association between smoking and HS, despite limitations in proving the causal relationship due to the retrospective design of the available studies. There is a consensus that patients with HS who are active smokers have a higher number of affected body areas than patients with HS who do not smoke or have stopped smoking. Similarly, it is recommended for patients with HS to discontinue tobacco use because of its association with weaker treatment response. Studies on the pathophysiological mechanism of smoking on the skin show that tobacco smoke with many of its chemicals as well as nicotine promote the proinflammatory cytokines found in HS lesions, activate the nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChRs) and aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHRs), and further suppress Notch signaling pathway.", "Year": 2020, "PublicationType": ["Journal Article", "Review"], "PubMedLink": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32650845/", "Qualifers": [], "citedby": 0, "last_author": "Branka Marinovi\u0107", "authors": ["Zrinka Bukvi\u0107 Mokos", "Jo\u0161ko Mi\u0161e", "Anamaria Bali\u0107", "Branka Marinovi\u0107"], "journal_name": "Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC", "journal_issn": "18476538", "journal_rank": 50000, "recency_score": 1.0, "citedby_score": 0.0, "journal_rank_score": 0.0, "overall_score": 0.33, "hindex": 0, "hindex_score": 0.0}, {"PMID": "39336506", "Title": "Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Elderly Patients: Clinical and Therapeutical Outcomes-A Review of the Literature.", "Abstract": "The management of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) in elderly patients presents unique challenges due to its chronic inflammatory nature, heterogeneous clinical presentation and comorbidities.

However, chronic skin inflammation can result when barrier function is defective and immune responses are dysregulated or misdirected against harmless or self-antigens. During the last 15 years interleukin (IL)-17 cytokines have emerged as key players in multiple inflammatory disorders, and they appear to be especially prominent in skin inflammation. IL-17 cytokines produced by T cells and other cell types potently activate keratinocytes to promote inflammation in a feed-forward loop. Given this key pathogenic role of the IL-17 pathway in autoimmune and inflammatory disease, it has been the focus of intense efforts to target therapeutically. The inflammatory effects of IL-17 can be targeted directly by blocking the cytokine or its receptor, or indirectly by blocking cytokines upstream of IL-17-producing cells. Psoriasis has been the major success story for anti-IL-17 drugs, where they have proven more effective than in other indications. Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is another inflammatory skin disease which, despite carrying a higher burden than psoriasis, is poorly recognized and under-diagnosed, and current treatment options are inadequate. Recently, a key role for the IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of HS has emerged, prompting clinical trials with a variety of IL-17 inhibitors.

The primary aim of this review is to explore the connection between diet and HS progression. However, it is imperative to note that the evidence supporting a substantial role of the diet in HS remains weak. Dietary alterations alone should not be considered independent solutions for managing HS. Medical therapy continues to be indispensable for adequate treatment. Research indicates that the Mediterranean lifestyle and diet may provide cost-effective and beneficial adjustments when combined with traditional therapies. Conversely, foods with a high glycemic index and dairy could worsen HS symptoms, conceivably through mechanisms linked to insulin resistance and inflammation. Zinc, known for its antioxidant properties, shows promise as an adjunct therapy. Moreover, evidence suggests a connection between vitamin D deficiency and HS severity, although the findings are inconclusive. Brewer's yeast-free diet, B12 supplementation, intermittent fasting, and reducing the intake of refined sugar and dairy merit further investigation.

The average worldwide prevalence is 1% but varies geographically. Hidradenitis suppurativa has a profound negative effect on patients' quality of life and on the gross value added to society. Comorbidities (eg, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease) frequently accompany skin alterations, because of systemic inflammation. Pathogenesis of hidradenitis suppurativa is complex and includes innate immune mechanisms (eg, macrophages, neutrophils, IL-1\u03b2, tumour necrosis factor [TNF], and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), T-cell mechanisms (eg, IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3), and B-cell mechanisms (eg, associated with dermal tertiary lymphatic structures and autoantibodies). Chronic inflammation leads to irreversible skin damage with tunnel formation and morbid scarring. Current treatment includes drug therapy (for the initial, purely inflammatory phase), combined drug and surgical therapy (for the destructive phase), or surgery alone (for the burnout phase).

Prior research aimed at identifying HS subtypes has largely focused on phenotypic classifications derived from clinical features of cutaneous lesions. Limitations of existing HS taxonomies emphasize a need for a more nuanced understanding of disease subtypes. Evidence that has emerged from initial genetic studies of HS suggests the presence of at least three HS subtypes, each of which has different clinical implications in terms of disease risks and drug responses.

IL-17 has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of HS and evidence highlights the potential of IL-17-targeted therapies. The fully human IgG/\u03ba monoclonal antibody secukinumab, which specifically targets IL-17A and inhibits interaction with its receptor, has recently been approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe HS. Secukinumab offers patients an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment option in terms of sustained response by rapidly improving signs and symptoms, and preventing disease progression in the absence of loss of response. Being a challenging disease, HS is associated with a delay to diagnosis of 3-10\u00a0years and, consequently, late implementation of appropriate treatment, leading to disease progression. Misdiagnosis due to flawed understanding and lack of awareness among medical providers and patients is considered an important factor contributing to the delayed diagnosis. Thus, serious efforts must be made on a large scale to urgently reduce the delay in HS diagnosis and reduce the disease burden in patients, including raising awareness, implementation of education programmes at medical and specialisation schools, as well as continuous education of healthcare providers at different levels for the early detection of HS and initiation of appropriate treatment.

New insights into the genomic landscape of HS have identified a number of genes that contribute to the development of HS in a polygenic manner, contributing to inflammatory dysregulation and alterations in epidermal stem cell fate in the follicular unit. These genomic variations can explain unique aspects of the disease such as the development and presence of epithelialized tunnels and abnormalities in wound healing. From genetic and translational studies, it is likely that these genetic alterations predispose to an innate immune dysregulation that can be triggered through sex hormone-responsive transcription factors with hormonal changes such as puberty, pregnancy and the menstrual cycle. The role of sex hormones in HS also has direct effects upon the development and maturation of inflammatory cells such as monocytes, which has the potential to explain differential patient response to treatments such as interleukin-23 antagonism. The role of adipose tissue as an active immunological organ also plays a role in the immune dysregulation seen in the disease. Fibrotic tissue and immunologically active fibroblasts play a significant role in the perpetuation of inflammation and development of adaptive immune dysfunction in the disease. The cutaneous and gut microbiomes play significant roles in the activation of innate immunity, although conflicting data exist as to their central or peripheral role in disease pathogenesis.

Chronic inflammation is linked to the development and progression of cancer in multiple organ systems - about 20% of all human cancers are a result of chronic inflammation - skin included. While acute inflammation under normal circumstances is a mechanism for host defence and tissue regeneration following insult by trauma or infection by pathogens, over the long term it can drive oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells and promote cancer development, growth and metastasis. Therefore, inflammatory conditions may put individuals at a higher risk to developing skin malignancies. Many skin conditions are characterized by chronic inflammatory processes. These conditions may be particularly susceptible to malignant transformation and predispose patients to develop skin malignancies. As more pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory skin conditions is unveiled, we find that many of these conditions are characterized by immune dysregulation and signalling that result in chronic activation and upregulation of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, leading to downstream processes that further exacerbate inflammatory processes and cause abnormal cell growth and apoptosis. Here, we review the major chronic cutaneous inflammatory diseases that may have an increased risk of skin malignancies, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, hidradenitis suppurativa, prurigo nodularis, lichen sclerosus, systemic sclerosis and morphea, chronic leg ulcers, seborrheic keratoses and basal cell carcinoma.

Quantitative drainage tools enable more reliable comparisons of drainage severity and treatment response between patients but sometimes require equipment to administer, increasing responder burden. Gaps in the current wound drainage measurement landscape are highlighted. Many of the existing scales have not been validated in robust studies.

When initial medical treatments fail, surgical interventions, including laser and non-laser procedures, may be considered. This review examines recent studies investigating the effectiveness of these procedures, focusing on publications since March 2019. The review included English-language case reports, studies, and clinical trials sourced from PubMed using search terms such as \"hidradenitis suppurativa,\" \"Nd: YAG,\" \"photodynamic therapy,\" \"intense pulsed light,\" \"alexandrite,\" \"diode,\" \"CO2,\" \"radiofrequency,\" \"ablative,\" \"fractionated,\" \"laser,\" and \"hair removal.\" Review articles and animal studies were excluded. The review found strong evidence supporting the use of Nd: YAG and CO2 lasers for reducing inflammatory lesions and excising sinus tracts. Alexandrite lasers also showed promise, with 50% of treated patients achieving a Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) at 15 weeks, increasing to 70% by week 30. Fractional radiofrequency (RF) microneedling and radiofrequency-intense pulsed light (RF-IPL) combinations led to reduced inflammation and improved tissue remodeling by weeks 6 and 24, respectively. Both intralesional and traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT) approaches demonstrated efficacy in reducing lesion size and associated symptoms.

Specifically, the dysregulation of the Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) cascade plays a central role in the pathogenesis of many skin conditions. JAK inhibitors, with their ability to selectively target immune responses, are potential treatment options. Using the National Library of Medicine, we provide a comprehensive review of the use of United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and emerging JAK or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitors in a wide range of dermatologic conditions, including psoriasis, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus, hidradenitis suppurativa, dermatomyositis, lichen planus, lichen planopilaris, sarcoidosis and graft-versus-host disease. In patients with psoriasis, oral deucravacitinib (TYK2 inhibitor) has been approved as a once-daily therapy with demonstrated superiority and efficacy over apremilast and placebo and tolerable safety profiles. In patients with vitiligo, topical ruxolitinib (JAK1 inhibitor) is approved as a twice-daily treatment for repigmentation. The efficacy of several other JAK inhibitors has also been demonstrated in several clinical trials and case studies for systemic lupus erythematosus, hidradenitis suppurativa, dermatomyositis, lichen planus, lichen planopilaris, sarcoidosis and graft-versus-host disease.

While much is known about TLS linked to mucosal epithelium, their formation in the skin epithelium and the supporting microenvironment remains unclear. Using multiomics, we uncovered the presence of TLSs in a severe chronic inflammatory skin disease, Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS), and showed that lymphocyte proliferation exclusively occurs in TLSs, predominantly located in adjacent to the unique epithelialized tunnels in lesional skin. Notably, we found extensive clonal expansion of plasma cells generating antibodies specific to HS lesional keratinocytes across different patients, alongside the proliferation of Tfh, Treg, and pathogenic T cells (IL17A+ and IFNG+). Additionally, we identified two distinct skin fibroblast populations with transcriptional signatures resembling stromal cells in secondary lymphoid organs (SLO), expressing CXCL13 or CCL19, in response to immune cytokines. Employing a microfluidic system to mimic TLSs-on-a-chip, we demonstrated that HS lesional fibroblasts are critical in orchestrating lymphocyte aggregation and proliferation, which involve TNF\u03b1-CXCL13 and TNF\u03b1-CCL19 feedback loops with B and T cells, respectively. Furthermore, our study revealed that early TNF\u03b1 blockade effectively suppresses lymphocyte aggregation, but not after aggregates are formed, underscoring the critical role of TNF\u03b1 during the initiation of the lymphoid aggregation. Through dissecting the intricate network interactions between immune and mesenchymal cells within the HS lesion, our work revealed the crucial mechanism sustaining chronicity in Hidradenitis Suppurativa and potentially other autoimmune diseases.", "Title": ["Dynamic Immune-mesenchymal interplay within the tertiary lymphoid structures promotes autoimmune pathogenesis in Hidradenitis Suppurativa"], "OrganismID": ["9606"], "Platform": {"GPL16791": "Illumina HiSeq 2500 (Homo sapiens)"}, "Design": ["Single cell RNA sequencing was performed for a total of 29 samples collected from 8 HS patients and 2 healthy control donors.

hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is grossly inadequate. A better understanding of its pathogenesis is required to design new therapeutic strategies. Despite an incidence of approximately 1 in 200, HS is underrecognized and underdiagnosed, with a high morbidity and poor quality of life, which may last decades. In this study we first employed single cell RNA sequencing to analyse gene expression in immune cells isolated from HS lesions compared with healthy control skin. We identified 30 unique immune cell clusters, with a significant enrichment in the frequency of plasma cells, Th17 cells and a subset of dendritic cells (DC) in HS skin. These findings were validated by flow cytometry, which revealed a significant increase in infiltrating immune cells in HS skin, including T cells, B cells, neutrophils, dermal macrophages and DC. The sequencing analysis revealed that the immune transcriptome in HS skin was distinct and much more heterogenous, when compared with healthy skin. Genes and pathways associated with Th17 cells and IL-17, IL-1\u03b2, and the NLRP3 inflammasome were enhanced in HS skin, particularly in samples with a high inflammatory load. Inflammasome constituent genes principally mapped to Langerhans cells and a subpopulation of DC. A skin explant model showed that culture of HS skin with an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor reduced the inflammatory response, with significant reduction of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-17A as well as other key mediators of inflammation.

However, the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) inhibitors in cutaneous wound healing in vivo is still unclear. To examine and compare the efficacy of various TNF inhibitors in cutaneous wound healing in vivo, a human TNF knock-in Leprdb/db mouse model was established to model the impaired cutaneous wound healing as seen in HS. The vehicle group exhibited severe impairments in cutaneous wound healing. In contrast, adalimumab significantly accelerated healing, confirmed by both histologic assessment and a unique healing transcriptional profile. Moreover, adalimumab and infliximab showed similar levels of efficacy, but golimumab was less effective, along with etanercept and certolizumab-pegol. In line with histologic assessments, proteomics analyses from healing wounds exposed to various TNF inhibitors revealed distinct and differential wound healing signatures that may underlie the differential efficacy of these inhibitors in accelerating cutaneous wound healing. Taken together, these data revealed that TNF inhibitors exhibited differential levels of efficacy in accelerating cutaneous wound healing in the impaired wound healing model in vivo likely through distinct mechanisms of action related to the structure of the biologic or its ability to bind TNF.", "Title": ["Therapeutic TNF Inhibitors Exhibit Differential Levels of Efficacy in Accelerating Cutaneous Wound Healing"], "OrganismID": ["10090"], "Platform": {"GPL19057": "Illumina NextSeq 500 (Mus musculus)"}, "Design": ["Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data from wounded mouse skin treated with Adalimumab or control (three biological replicates) at three timepoints."], "PubMedIDs": [], "PubMedURLs": [], "ExperimentType": "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing", "Samples": [{"SampleID": "GSM7771794", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 2", "time: Day 10", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771795", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 3", "time: Day 10", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771796", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 1", "time: Day 7", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771797", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 2", "time: Day 7", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771798", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 3", "time: Day 7", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771799", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 2", "time: Day 10", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771800", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 1", "time: Day 7", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771801", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 2", "time: Day 7", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771802", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 3", "time: Day 7", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771803", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 1", "time: Day 10", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771804", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 1", "time: Day 10", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771805", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 1", "time: Day 0", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771806", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 1", "time: Day 3", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771807", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 2", "time: Day 0", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771808", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 2", "time: Day 3", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771809", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 3", "time: Day 0", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771810", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 3", "time: Day 3", "treatment: control"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771811", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 1", "time: Day 0", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771812", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 1", "time: Day 3", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771813", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 2", "time: Day 0", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771814", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 2", "time: Day 3", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771815", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 3", "time: Day 0", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}, {"SampleID": "GSM7771816", "TissueType": "skin", "Characteristics": ["tissue: skin", "biological replicate: 3", "time: Day 3", "treatment: Adalimumab"]}], "Organism": ["Mouse"], "PlatformNames": ["Illumina NextSeq 500"], "StudyType": "bulkRNA"}, {"GseID": "GSE220116", "Summary": "Background: Based on the mounting evidence that Type 17 T-cells (T17 cells) and increased IL-17 play a key role in driving hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) lesion development, biologics previously used in psoriasis that block signaling of IL-17A and/or IL-17F isoforms have been repurposed to treat HS. Objective: Our aim was to characterize the transcriptome of HS T17 cells compared to the transcriptome of psoriasis T17 cells, and their ligand-receptor interactions with neighborhood immune cell subsets. Methods: Single-cell data of 12,300 cutaneous immune cells from 8 de-roofing surgical HS skin samples that included dermal tunnels were compared with single-cell data of psoriasis skin (19,525 cells from 11 samples) and control skin (11,920 cells from 10 samples). All the single-cell data were generated by the identical protocol. Results: HS T17 cells expressed lower levels of IL23R and higher levels of IL1R1 and IL17F compared to psoriasis T17 cells (p < 0.05). HS regulatory T-cells (Tregs) expressed higher levels of IL1R1 and IL17F compared to psoriasis Tregs (p < 0.05). Semimature dendritic cells (DCs) were the major immune cell subsets expressing IL1B in HS, and IL-1B ligand-receptor interactions between semimature DCs and T17 cells were increased in HS compared to psoriasis (p < 0.05). HS dermal tunnel keratinocytes (KCs) expressed inflammatory cytokines (IL17C, IL1A, IL1B, and IL6) different from HS epidermis KCs (IL36G) (p < 0.05). IL6, which synergizes with IL1B to maintain cytokine expression in T17 cells, was mainly expressed by fibroblasts in HS, which also expressed IL11+ inflammatory fibroblast genes (IL11, IL24, IL6, and POSTN) involved in paracrine IL-1/IL-6 loop. Conclusion: The IL-1B-T17 cell cytokine axis is likely a dominant pathway in HS with HS T17 cells activated by IL-1B signaling, unlike psoriasis T17 cells which are activated by IL-23 signaling.

Given that macrophages (M\u03c6) play pivotal roles throughout the wound healing process, an in-vitro M\u03c6 differentiation assay was carried out to assess the impact of TNF-anti-TNF complexes on these cells. TNF-ADA complexes exhibited stronger inhibitory effects on inflammatory M\u03c6 differentiation. Moreover, RNA sequencing revealed several unique wound healing profiles for TNF-ADA-treated inflammatory M\u03c6s, which were not observed for those treated with either TNF-ETN or TNF-CZP, including the inhibition of the matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) pathway. In addition, ADA administration was found to significantly reduce the levels of inflammatory MMPs -1 and -9 while promoting wound healing MMP-13 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2) levels in the circulation of those HS patients who responded to treatment. Our in-vitro findings demonstrate that TNF-ADA-treated inflammatory M\u03c6s exhibit a distinct profile resembling wound healing. Moreover, ADA not only differentially regulates MMP expression in HS patients responding to the therapy but potentially induces a transition to a profile suggestive of wound healing.", "Title":

Here we show in single cell RNA-seq comparisons of semi-regenerative and fibrotic WIHN wounds, increased expression of phagocytic/lysosomal genes in macrophages associated with predominance of fibrotic myofibroblasts in fibrotic wounds. Investigation revealed that macrophages in the late wound drive fibrosis by phagocytizing dermal Wnt inhibitor SFRP4 to establish persistent Wnt activity. In accordance, phagocytosis abrogation resulted in transient Wnt activity and a more regenerative healing. Phagocytosis of SFRP4 was integrin-mediated and dependent on the interaction of SFRP4 with the EDA splice variant of fibronectin. In the human skin condition Hidradenitis suppurativa, phagocytosis of SFRP4 by macrophages correlated with fibrotic wound repair.
